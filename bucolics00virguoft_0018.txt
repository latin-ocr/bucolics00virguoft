14 INTRODUCTION.

figurecl. His Lycidas, a tribute of sorrow to the memory of
a deceased friend, is partly modelled on Virgil’s tenth Eclogue,
and recognises the Greek and Roman pastorals as the source
of his inspiration ¹. His Latin pastoral elegy, Epitaphium
Damonis, takes its title from the Ἐπιτάφιος Βίωνος of Mos-
chus, and contains many reminiscences of the Eclogues ².
The next century is marked by the appearance of Pope's
Pastorals of the four seasons (1709), in many parts closely
imitated from Virgil, and his Messiah, entitled ‘A Sacred
Eclogue in imitation of Virgil’s Pollio.’ Allan Ramsay's
Gentle Slzeplzerd (1725) is a genuine rustic pastoral,’and its
Lowland Scotch dialect recals to our ears something of the
Doric rudeness of the Sicilian Idyll. But pastoral poetry‚
which had influenced the taste of so many generations, was
fast wearing itself out ; soon it fell into complete disuse, and
may now be regarded as obsolete beyond possibility of
revival.

The composition of the Eclogues appears to have extended
¹over a period of five or six years ³, from 43 or 42 to 37 B.C.
The order in which they stand was probably arranged by
Virgil himself. The Tityrus naturally comes first, from
its biographical importance, and as a tribute of respect
to Octavianus, whose supremacy was by this time nearly
established. The third and fourth Eclogues are connected
by kindred subjects—the glorious age ushered in by Pollio's
consulship and the rapturous reign of peace attending the

²³ Suetonius says ‘Bucolica triennio perfecit.’ Prof. Nettleship
attributes this error to a calculation from the dates of the first and
last Eclogues in their published order (40 to 37 B.C.). Sellar
suggests that Virgil originally intended to conclude with the eighth
Eclogue (written in 39), as implied by the words in 1. 11 ‘tibi
desinit) but that he added the tenth two years later, in honour of his
friend and patron. C. Cornelius Gallus.
