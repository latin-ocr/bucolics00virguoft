10. 28 καὶ τὸ ἴον μέλαν ἐντὶ καῖ ἁ ’γραπτὰ ὑάκινθος. For the thought
cp. 2. 16. In 1. 40 some understand aut after salices. This is
awkward‚ perhaps hardly possible. We must suppose that vines
were sometimes trained on willows, especially where, as in Virgil's
native district, larger trees were scarce. Forbiger suggests a hill
slope planted with vines and willows at its foot. For lenta cp.
1. 4 n.

42, 43. He now imagines himself to be sharing this life of
Arcadian bliss with Lycoris herself. The transition is abrupt, but

tu potes insolitas, Cynthia, ferre nives?'

50, 51. Chalcidico refers to Euphorion of Chalcis, in Euboea,
who flourished in the third century B.C. Gallus had translated or
adapted some of his poems; these he will now (he says) ⁴ attune ’ to
pastoral strains. For modulabor cp. 5. 143 for avena 1. 2. The

That every eye which in this forest looks
Shall see thy virtue witnessed everywhere.'
