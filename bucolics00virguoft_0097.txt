at the probable consequences when Silenus awoke (l. 13 n.), from
which the frail nature of the bands could be no real protection. Aegle
is bolder, and plays her part in the trick as the god is ‘ awakening ’
(videnti).

24. potuisse videri, ‘to have seemed (thought yourselves) to
have the power.' The other interpretation (me) potuisse videri,
⁶ that I can have been visible‘ [the wood-gods showing themselves
to mortals only when they pleased) is far less likely.

26. mercediS, partitive gen., ‘another kind> of reward,’ i. e. ⁵ 1’11
pay her off in some other way? ipse=ultr0, ‘without more ado.'
Cf. 4. 21 n.

27. in numerum, ‘in measured dance’ (C.). Cp. Lucr. 2. 631
(of the Curetes) ‘ludunt in numerumque exsultant.’ Milton imi·
tated this line in Lycidas 34 ‘rough Satyrs danced and F anns with
cloven heel.’

29, 30. tantum, with the relative (quantum) clause understood,
as in 5. 82,=·'so much ’ as did the hills and rocks when Silenus
sang. Rhodope and Ismarus were mountain haunts of Orpheus
in Thrace. So in G. 4. 461 the ‘ Rhodopeiae arces ' moum in sym—

31-40. These lines give a short abstract of the Epicurean system
ot* cosmogony, described at length by Lucretius, 5. 416—508. Accord-
ing to this doctrine the ‘ great void ' was at first filled with moving
particles or atoms (semina). By eoncourse of similar atoms the
universe was gradually formed, and the four elements took their
relative positions. In Lucretius the atoms themselves are called
primordia rerum, whence the exordia, or ‘rudiments ’ of things had
their origin. Virgil's liquidus ignis, ‘streaming fire‘ (C.)‚ an-
swers to Lucretius’ ignifer aether, which rises to the highest place
and enwraps the universe by expansion. This ‘ soft elastic orb of
aether,’ according to Munro, is what Virgil means by tener mundi
orbis, which now ‘grew into a whole' (concreverit). Cp. Lucr.
5. 467 ‘levis ac diffusilis aether Corpore concreto circumdatus un-
dique flexit.' But it seems more natural to understand tener mundi
orbis of the ‘young world-globe,' now growing into shape3 ipse
marking off the distinction from the mere exordia, and tener con·
trasting with durare in next line. For meanings of mundus see
4. 50 n.

35. durare, prob. intransitive, though some take solum as its
object„ with orbis as subject of the verb. discludere Nerea ponto,
‘ to shut off (confine) the sea-water in its bed.' Lucretius says that
the removal of the sun and moon to a middle space between earth
and aether made hollows in the earth, which'the sea-waters filled.
