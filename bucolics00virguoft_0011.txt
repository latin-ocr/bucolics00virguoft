EARLY LIFE OF VJRGJL. 7

published) is clearly traceable in the sixth Eclogue, in Aen.
i. 740, vi. 724, etc. and other passages of his works.

Following the Life by Suetonius we read——‘ Mox cum
res Romanas incohasset, offensus materia ad Bucolica tran-
siit.' This evidently means that Virgil began a history of
Rome in verse, or a poem on the wars of Rome*6 reges et
proelia ' Ecl. vi. 3—but found the task beyond his powers ¹ ;
or, as he himself says, Apollo warned him to desist, and
confine himself to the slighter themes of rural poetry.
It is not, however, till some years later that we find
him actually employed on the Eclogues. · During the
civil war between Caesar and Pompey, which broke out
in 49 B. C., Virgil was probably domiciled in his native
Andes, where in the intervals of farm—work he would have
ample time for pursuing his literary studies. The influ-
⁸ enee of Greek poetry, especially the Idylls of Theocritus,
must have powerfully affected him ; hence his earlier com-
positions took the form of pastoral or bucolic poenis, as
being congenial to his habits of thought, and easily imitable
in their subjects and manner of expression. Hitherto
nothing of the sort had been attempted at Rome, for al-
though the inhabitants of ancient Italy were devoted to
agricultural pursuits, these were of so practical a kind, as
to leave no room for leisure and contemplation. But the
rural descriptions of Theocritus could not fail to charm, and¹
Virgil must have struck a responsive chord‚ when he en-
deavoured to reproduce them to Roman ears. It is quite
likely that he wrote many other specimens of bucolic verse,
besides what have come down to us, during this period of
retirement3 the earliest of the ‘selections’ can hardly how·
ever be assigned to an earlier date than the year of Philippi
(42 Β. C.) or the one preceding.

¹ So Milton in his youth formed the idea of writing a British epie,
as well as a Scriptural tragedy. The one eventually became a prose'
History of Britain, the other (like Virgil's Aenez'd) developed into
an epic poem, the paradise Lost.
