come up against us.’ ipsae, ipsa. Cp. 1. 40 n. deuS, etc„ is the
exclamation of the rocks and trees. Cp. Pope's Messz'alz 31
‘A God! a God! the vocal hills reply;
The rocks proclaim the approaching Deity.'
65, 66. sis bonus, etc.; imitated by Milton, Lyc. 183
‘ [thou] shalt be good
To all that wander in that perilous flood.'

arae, ordinary altars; altaria, high altars for burnt-ofi‘erings; but
Virgil may not have intended the distinction here. In 1. 43 he
assigns altaria to Octavian. A ltare is from altus with termination
(not from ara). duas (aras) in apposition to altaria. Two seems to
have been the usual number ; so Andromache erects ‘ geminas aras '
to Hector’s shade, A. 3. 305. [On the union of the worship of
Julius Caesar with that of Apollo (supposing Daphnis to represent
Caesar) see introduction to Eclogue.]

67, 68. bina, not here distributive. Cp. 3. 30. According to
Wagner the milk is for spring-time, the oil for autumn Qbut see note
on frigus and messis l. 702. s‘uatuam3 cp. A. 1. 724 ‘crateras
magnas statuunt.' This is from Theoc. 5. 53 στασῶ δὲ κρητῆρα
μέγαν λευκοῖο γάλακτος ᾖ ταῖς Νύμφαις· στασῶ δὲ καὶ ἁδέος ἄλλον
ἐλαίου.

69. convivia, the usual ‘banquet ’ after sacrifice.

. 70. The festivals appear to be defined by l. 75, where *the second
is evidently the Ambarvalia (3. 77 n.). But this took place in the
spring ιζ G. Ι. 340), which hardly answers to frigus. Virgil probably
means a biennial festival, loosely denoted by hot and cold weather,
without any more definite reference to seasons.

71. calathis, here ‘goblets' or ‘flagons' (not ·baskets‚’ as in
2. 46). So in G. 3. 4cz it probably means ‘milk-cans.' Ariusia,
a town and district of Chios. Chian wine was in great repute;
hence the term nectar, denoting something very choice. In G. 2. 98
Virgil calls the wine of Phanae in the same island the ‘king’ of
wines.

72. Shortened from Theoc. 7. 71 αὐλησεῦντι δέ μοι δύο ποιμένες,
etc. Lyctius, from Lycte in Crete; a literary epithet here. Cp.
1. 273 1. 55; 10. 59n.

73. The uncouth dances of the Satyrs, legendary eompanions of
Bacchus, are referred to in G. 1. 350 ‘ det motus incompositus‚’ etc.
Alphesiboeus (ἀλφεσίβοιος), lit. ‘winner of oxen‚' an imaginary
shepherd. Cp. Meliboeus 1. 6.

74, 75. virgil has borrowed the Nymph festivals from Theo.
critus, who often mentions them. sollemnia seems to imply a yearly
celebration‚ perhaps in summer or early autumn (l. 70 n.). For
