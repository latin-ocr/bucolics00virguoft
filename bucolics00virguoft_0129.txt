ARETHUSA.

A POEM. ΒΥ PERcv BYSSHE SHELLEY, 1820.

Arethusa arose
From her coueh of snows

In the Acroceraunian mountains3
From cloud and from erag
With many a jag

Shepherding her bright fountains.
She leapt down the rocks
With her rainbow looks

Streaming among the streams;
Her steps paved with green
The downward ravine

Which slopes to the western gleams:
And gliding and springing,
She went, ever singing,

In murmurs as soft as sleep;
The Earth seemed to love her,
And-Heaven smiled above her,

As she lingered towards the deep.

Then Alpheus bold,
On his glacier cold,
With his trident the mountains strook;
And opened a chasm
In the rocks 3—with the spasm
All Erymanthus shook.
And the black south wind
It concea1ed behind
The ums of the silent snow,
And earthquake and thunder
Did rend in sunder
The bars of the springs below:
The beard and the hair
Of the river-god were
