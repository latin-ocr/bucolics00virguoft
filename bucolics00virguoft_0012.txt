8 JNTR OD UCTJON.

In 41 Β. C. the lands in the district of Cremona and the
neighbouring Mantua were appropriated by the veterans of
Octavianus and Antony‚ and Virgil’s father among others
lost his estate. In his ninth Eclogue Virgi] appealed to
Varus, the governor of Cisalpine Gaul, and having by his
influence, in conjunction with Pollio and Gallus, obtained
restitution, he wrote his first Eclogue as a memorial of
gratitude for the favour ¹.

During this troublous time he seems to have taken refuge
in a villa that once belonged to his old master Siron, the
locality of which is unknown ². It is probable that Virgil
did not continue long at Andes after the restoration of his
property. The liberality of Octavian and Maecenas had
secured him leisure and comparative wealth, and we know
from the concluding lines of the fourth Georgic that he was
soon afterwards residing at N aples. There is also a passage
in Propertius 3 (iii. 26. 67 ) intimating that the seventh Eclogue
was written at or near Tarentum, and his descriptions of
scenery in the Eclogues (when he is not obviously copying
Theocritus)¹ are better suited to the ‘ sunny south ’ of Italy
than to the bare and level district surrounding Mantua.

In his notice of the Bucolics Suetonius goes on to say
that they were written ‘chiefly in praise of Varus, Pollio,
and Gallus! Two Eclogues, the fourth and tenth, are entirely
devoted to the two last—named patrons ; the sixth is dedicated
to Varus and includes an incidenta] compliment to Gallus.

¹ See Introductions to the first and ninth Eclogues for the probable

order of events in the life of Virgil.
² This is referred to in the tenth poem of the Catalepton—

‘Villula quae Sironis eras, et pauper agene,
Verum illi domino tu quoque divitiae;

Me tibi, et hos una meeum, quos semper amavi,
Si quid de patria tristius audiero,

Commendo, in primisque patrem. Tu nunc eris illi,
Mantua quod fuerat quodque Cremona prius.'

‘ Tu canis umbrosi subter pineta Galaesi
Thyrsin et attritis Daphnin arundinibus.'
