12 INTRODUCTION.

theless the fact that Virgil regarded himself and was accepted
by his contemporaries as an orzgz'nal poet. In the sixth
Eclogue he boasts of having been the first to introduce pastoral
poetry at Rome, while here, as elsewhere, he distinctly ac-
knowledges his obligations to the Sicilian Muses that inspired
Theocritus. To a Roman the literature of Greece was the
supreme and only model of excellence3 hence he who best
succeeded in reproducing the ideas, language, and metre of

‚, a Greek writer was deemed worthy of the highest praise for

originality, where a modern author might justly incur the
charge of plagiarism. Yet Virgil is no vulgar copyist ; often,
it is true, he falls below his model and occasionally mis-
apprehends him1 ; he is inferior to Theocritus in variety of
characters, precision of scenery, consistency of treatment,
everything in short that constitutes dramatic power 3 yet his
Eclogues have abundant charms of their own. In the arts
of refinement and elegance, delicacy of feeling, most of all in
his perfect grace of expression attuned to the rich music of
melodious verse, Virgil is admittedly without a rival. So
irresistible is his influence, as to make us forget or even con-
done all defects and incongruities, and it is Virgil‚ rather than
Theocritus, that modern pastoral poets have taken as their
model for imitation.

It may perhaps appear strange that the Romans, claiming
as they did descent from a pastoral ancestry and nursed as
they were by a regular recurrence of festivals in pastoral
recollections, should afterwards have paid little regard to the
cultivation of bucolic poetry3 yet the later poets‚ such as
Calpurnius and Nemesianus, occupy but a low place among
the post-augustan writers 2. Their poetry is at best an imi-
tation of well-known passages in Virgil’s Eclogues; and
though it preserves all the unreality of the Virgilian pastoral,
it has little of the master’s grace and elegance by way of
compensation. Other names of even less note need not here
