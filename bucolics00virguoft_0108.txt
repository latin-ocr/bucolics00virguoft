NOTES To THE ECLOGUES.

such a husband as Mopsus. hirsutum supercilium is from the
λασὶα ὀφρύς of Polyphemus in Theoc. 11. 31.

38, 39. saepibus = ‘orchard.' roscida, δροσόεντα, ‘ wet with
morning dew.' matre, ‘ my mother‚' ἐμᾷ σὺν ματρί Theoc. 11. 26.
So dux ego, etc. is from ἐγὼ δ1 ὁδὸν ἁγεμόνευον ib. 27.

40. alter ab undecimo, ‘the twelfth’ (not ‘thirteenth’), as the
Romans reckoned dates inclusively. So ‘ alter ab illo ’ 5. 49 = ‘next
in order.'

42. ut . . . ut, ‘when . . . how.’ Cp. Theoc. 2. 82 χώς ἴδον ὡς
ἐμάνην, also Hom. Il. 14. 294 ὡς δ’ ἴδεν, ὥς μιν ἔρως πυκινὰς φρένας
ἀμφεκάλυψεν. For the hiatus in perii, ut cp. 3. 6 n. Here the
pause makes the effect less harsh.

44. Virgil has the short 0 only in scio and nescio. In Ovid we
find negb‘, petc‘2‘‚ desino', etc., and later on the practice became common.
See Juvenal passim. quid sit=‘ the nature’ of Love. Cp. for dis-
tinction ‘ quae sit virtus’ 4. 27 n. cotibus, a form of cautibus. So
plodere‚ plostrum, codex, Clodius, etc. for plaudere, plaustrum, etc.

45, 46. The idea is repeated in the appeal of Dido to Aeneas,
A. 4. 366. Virgil may have had Hom. Il. 6. 34 in mind. Mount
Tmaros was in Epirus.. For Rhodope see 6. 30 n. The Gara-
mantes were a remote African tribe, regarded as the southernmost
limit of the Roman empire. Cp. A. 6. 794. edunt. ‘ are the parents
of,' the pres. denoting continuance. Cp. Eur. [ph. T. 1319 ὃν
Τυνδαρὶς τίκτει κόρη. So in A. 8. 141 ‘Maiam . . . Atlas generat.'

48-51. The crime of Medea is mentioned as an instance of cruelty,
the effect of slighted love. The poet then asks which was more
cruel, the mother that slew her children, or that malicious boy
(Cupid) who incited her to the deed? He leaves the question un—
decided, repeating the statement that ‘the boy was wicked‚ yet the
mother was cruel-hearted t00.' [Others repeat magis with impro-
bus, i.e. ‘ was the mother's cruelty or the boy's malice greater?' This
is partly supported by the answer ‘improbus ille puer‚' but the promi—
nent point is the cruelly (l. 48), rather than the wickedness„ of Love.]

53-55. nunc, i.e. after the unnatural conduct of Nysa (l. 27) the
whole course of nature may be expected to change. For ultro cp.
3. 66 n. and for aurea mala ib. 71 n. This and the following lines
are from Theoc. Ι. 132 νῦν δ’ ἴα μὲν φορέοιτε βάτοι, φορέοιτε δ’
ἄκανθαι, l ἆ. δὲ καλὰ νάρκισσος ἔπ’ ἀρκεύθοισι κομάσαι. sudent, etc.
The trees by the Eridanus, into which Phaethon's sisters were
changed (6. 63 n.), were supposed to distil amber from their bark.
Imitated by Pope, past. 3. 37,—

‘Let opening roses knotted oaks adorn,
And liquid amber drop from every thom.’
