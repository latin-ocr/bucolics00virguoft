soME OF THE .' MORF. IMPORTANT VARIOUS
' READINGS AND EMENDATIONS.

Ecl. i, line 13. protenus (for protinus) in P. and many editions.
The distinction of meaning is imaginary (see note).

*1. 59. aequore (for aethere) in one MS. So Burmann, Ribbeck
and others. But aethere suits leves best. Cp. A. 6. 17 (of Daedalus)
‘ Chalcidicaque levis tandem super adstitit arce.'

1. 65. Cretae or cretae (see note). The uncial MSS. of course
cannot help us here. Ladewig (1883) reads certe. . . . ad Oxum.
The former (=‘doubtless') is tame, the latter is possible, the
names of rivers usually having a preposition prefixed, but there is
no MS. authority for it.

l. 72. en quis (‘ see for whom ') in some cursive MSS. adopted by
Wagner, Forbiger, etc.; his nos in P. and R. (M. is wanting).
The former reading may possibly have arisen from an attempt
to make t correspond with en quo preceding.

Ecl. ii, 11. 32 33 and 39 are bracketed by Ribbeck as spurious, but
against authority and with no sufficient reason.

Ecl. iii, l. 50. Dr. Kennedy reads Palaemon, efficiam, etc.‚ making
audiat a protasis, ‘if only we can get an umpire, aye Palaemon,
etc.’ This is possible, but the change seems unnecessary.

1. 60. principium musae (gen.) Ribbeck3 but the reference in
Theoc. 17. 1 (see note) is in favour of the vocative.

ll. 109, 110. The MSS. agree as to the text reading here. Many
alterations have been proposed ; e. g. Wagner ‘ et quisquis amores

.. haut metuet, dulces aut, etc.,’ Forbiger ‘haut metuet dulces,
haut, etc.,' Ribbeck ‘ lzau temnet dulces, haut, etc? These agree
in putting a full stop after ‘hic2' making ‘et quisquis, etc.’
a detached general expression (‘w”hoso shall not sear, he shall
not, etc.’). This is more abrupt and also less relevant to the
context than the text reading, which though doubtless obscure
and harshly expressed, need not on that account be considered
