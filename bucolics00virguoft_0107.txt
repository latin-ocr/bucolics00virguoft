The air is coldest just before sunrise.

16. incumbens olivae, either ‘leaning on his olive staff ' or
‘against an olive tree.’ The former is supported by the epithet
tereti, ‘smooth’ or ‘well-rounded' (cp. ‘teretes suras' Hor. Od.
2. 4. ΙΙ), and by the fact that, the shepherd's crook was often made
of olive wood. Cp. Theoc. 7. 18 ἀγριελαίω. . . κορύναν. But, as
K. observes, teres is used of trees in general, as in A. 6. 207 ‘ teretes
circumdare truncos‚’ and it is natural to suppose that the singers

age, ‘usher in.’ Milton, Song on Δία] ἀίονηίηξ, calls the morning

Hermione, the promised wife of Orestes. testibUS, ‘witnesses’ of

21-23. The refrain is from Theoc. 1. 64, etc. ἄρχετε βωκολικᾶς
Μῶσαι φίλαι, ἅρχετ’ ἀοιδᾶς. Maenalios = Arcadian, i. e. pastoral
(7. 4n.). argutum, ‘whispering’ Cp. 7. 1 n. amoreS, ‘love-
songs‚’ as in 10. 53.

24. For Pan as inventor of the shepherd's pipe see on 22 32. non
passus inertes, i. e. he made them serve for bucolic song.

26—28. quid non, etc. ‘what may we lovers not expect' in the
future. iungentur, ‘be mated' (not ‘yoked.’ as some take it).
Griffins (γρῦπες) were fabulous monsters with lions’ bodies and
eagles' heads, who guarded treasures of gold from the Arimaspi in
the Rhipaean mountains. See Hdt. 3. 113. ad pocu1a=‘p0tum,’
‘ to drink '; cp. G. 3. 529 ¹ pocula sint fontes liquidi? dammae, here
masc„ as in G. 3. 539, usually feminine.

30, 31. By Roman custom‚ which Virgil here transfers to Greece,
torches were carried in procession before the bride. Nuts were
thrown among the boys forming the escort, as a sign (see Catull.
61. 128) that the bridegroom had now abandoned childish sports,

deserit, ‘rises over,’ probably from Catull. 62. 7 ‘Oetaeos ostendit
Noctifer ignes? Virgil, as also Catullus, makes the morning and
evening stars appear in the same day (1. 17), rather perhaps from
