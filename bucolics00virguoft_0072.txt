NOTES TO THE ECLOGUES.

22. From Theoc. 11. 36, 37 τυρὸς δ’ οὐ λείπει μ’ οὔτ’ ἐν θέρει oi'rr’
ἐν ὀπώρῃ, οὐ χειμῶνος ἅκρω.

23. vocabat, ‘piped home,’ according to the practice of shep-
herds in ancient times, going before and calling their flocks, instead
of driving them. Cp. St. John 10. 3, 4.

24. For Amphion, the Theban harp-player, brother of Zethus,
see Class. Dict. Dircaeus, from Dirce the Theban spring; hence
Pindar is called the ‘ Dircaean swan,’ Hor. Od. 4. 2. 25. Actaeo,
commonly rendered ‘Attic,’ from Acte, the older name of Attica.
But as Mount Aracynthus was in Aetolia, we have either a geo-
graphical error (cp. 1. 62), or, as Heyne suggests, a literal reproduc—
tion of a line from some Greek poet, in which ἀκταίῳ meant ‘ craggy,’
from ἀκτή. The legends of Amphion are usually associated with
Mount Cithaeron in Boeotia.

For the lci'atus m the fifth foot, with a long vowel zn arsi, cp. 3. 6,
63; S. 41, 53. The rhythm (at the close of a verse) is Homeric‚
like Πηληιάδεω Ἀχιλῆος etc. So‘ Aonii: Aganippe'10.12,‘Dar-
danio Anchisae’ A. 1. 617.

25. nec sum adeo, etc„ ‘not so very plain? From Theoc. 6. 34
και ’γάρ θην οὐδ’ εἰδος” εχω κακόν, etc.

26. ventis, i. e. by their falling. Cp. A. 5. 673 ‘ placidi
straverunt aequora venti.’ The winds are treated as powers that
control the waves, to make them rise or fall. Thus in Hor. Od.
1. 3. 16 Notus is termed ‘arbiter Hadriae . . . tollere seu ponere
vult freta.’ For DaphniS, the pastoral hero of Sicily, see 5. 20, etc.

27. si fallit (better than fallatf, expressing a fact. The watery
mirror cannot ‘ play false.'

28. sordida, ‘homely,' in contrast with town refinements.
Alexis is supposed to be a verna or house-slave3 Corydon a slave of
the farm

30. hibisco, probably dative, ‘to the hibiscus‚' on which the
kids fed. The dat. for acc. with ad or in is common in Virgil <as ‘ it
clamor caelo' A. 5. 451). Cp. Hor. Od. 1. 24. 18 ‘nigro compu-
lerit Mercurius gregi.’ This is probable, because compellere seems
always to mean ‘drive ἴθ’ some place, the destination being ex-
pressed; otherwise we should naturally take hibisco as abl. ‘with
(a rod of) hibiscus.' If the hibiscus be ‘ marsh-mallow‚' a stalk of it
would hardly serve for a rod, but the identity of the plant is un-
certain <l. 18 Π.) In 10. 71 it is used for basket-making‚ and must
therefore have had some strength and pliancy (-C.).

32. calamos, i. e. the syrz'nx or fistula, pipe of many reeds
(l. 37), said to have been invented by Pan ; cp. 8. 24. The story is
told by Ovid, silet. 1. 689, etc.
