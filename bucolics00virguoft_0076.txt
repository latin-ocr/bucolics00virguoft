NOTES TO THE ECLOGUES.

cious,’ as in the legal term dolo malo. Cp. ‘ mala manu ' Tibull. 3.
5. 20.

13. perverse, ‘ cross-grained ’ (K).

16. The meaning probably is ‘what are masters (owners) to do
when thieves are so bold ?’ i. e. as you were when you stole the goat. '
Others take fureszservz', according to comic usage, and translate,
‘what treatment may I expect from the master, when a mere slave
dares to revile me thus? ’ But this is somewhat forced.

18-20. excipere, the regular term for ‘ snaring' wild animals, as
in Hor. Od. 3. 12. 10 ‘excipere aprum'3 Phaedr. 1. 11. 6 ‘feras ex·
cipere.’ Lycisca, probably the dog's name: ‘ Wolf ’3 though some
render it ‘mongrel,' i. e. of dog and wolf. carecta formed from
carex, like salictum, etc„ cp. 1. 39 n. Tityrus was Damon's herdsman.

21-23. non redderet, ‘ was he not to pay,' or, as we should say,
‘to have paid.’ Reddere is to pay what is due. Cp. Plaut. T rin. 1.
2. 96 ‘ Non ego illi argentum redderem? Non redderes.' si nescis,
colloquial,=‘let me tell yon.' Cp. Ov. Her. 20. 150.

24. For ellipse of se before posse cp. A. 3. 201 ‘ negat dis-

cernere?
25, 26. tu, sc. vicisti from l. 21. cera iuncta (κηρόδετος Theoc.

13. 14², the many-reeded Pan’s pipe [2. 32 n.j, in contrast with the
single reed contemptuously called stipula, ‘ a straw.’ See on avena,
1. 2. in triviis, ‘ at the crossway,' properly meet‘mg of three roads,
where the poor made offerings to Hecate, and only inferior per·
formers would play or sing.

27. Imitated by Milton, Lyc. 124 ‘grate on their scrannel pipes
of wretched straw.' disperdere, ‘ to murder’ ; the tune itself being
a poor one &miserum‘ſs and further spoilt by bad playing. The whole
passage is from Theoc. 5. 5 τὰν ποίαν σύριγγα; τὺ ’γὰρ mina, δῶλε
Συβάρτα, ἐκτάσω σύριγγα ; τί δ’ οὐκέτι σὺν Κορύδωνι ἀρκεῖ τοι καλάμας
αὐλὸν ποππύσδεν ἔχοντι;

29, 30. vitulam for vaccam. The next line is from Theoc. 1.
26, where the animals mentioned are a goat with two kids. Virgil
has not improved upon his original, for cows (as Keightley observes)
seldom have twins. In G. 3. 176 he discountenances the practice of
milking cows in calving time.

31. depono, ‘lay,‘ of a wager. But the simple ponere (1. 36) is
more generally used. So θέμεν Theoc. 5. 21.

32. ausim, also faxim (saxo), were retained in common use from
the old future forms in -so and -sz'm. Similarly, capso, adempso,
iusso, levassz‘m, curassz‘m, etc„ are found. tecum, ‘like you.’ Cp.

‘mecum’ 2.12 n.; also G. 1. 41.
These three lines are from Theoc. 8. 15, 16 οὐ θησῶ ποκα ἀμνόν,
