, ECLOGUE V. 13-40.

lions is of course inappropriate to Italy or Sicily, where the scene of
this Eclogue is laid. Theocritus made the same mistake, Id. 1. 72.
loquuntur, with acc. and inf. as in A. 1. 731 ‘ nam te dare iura lo-
quuntur.' Here however the hills and woods re-eclzo the howling of
the lions (C.).

29-31. Daphnis is said to have taught the shepherds the worship
of Bacchus. (For supposed allusion to Caesar and the Liberalia,
see introduction to Eclogue.) The ⁶ tigers,' with epithet ArmeniaS,
point to the eastern origin of the Bacchic rites. Cp. Α. 6. 805 ‘ Liber
agens celso Nysae de vertice tigres.’ thiasos, ‘revel-bands’ (from
θύειν, ‘to rush,' hence θυιάδες, οιαὶ. Cp. θυρσοφορεῖς θιάσους Eur.
Bacch. 558. The θύρσοι, here called hastas, were wands wreathed
or tipped with vine—leaves and ivy. Cp. ‘pampineas hastas' A.
7. 396. mollibus, prob. ‘wavingj‘ as in 4. 28. Others take it =
‘soft,’ in contrast to the hard spear·shasts. [Mol-lis is probably
connected with μαλ-ακός, ἀ-μαλ-ός, οἵα, not a contractiori of mobilis
from movere.]

32. arboribus, elms‚ etc., on which vines were trained: Cp.
1. 563 2. 70 n. These lines are varied from Theoc. S. 79 τᾷ δρυῒ
ταὶ βάλανοι κόσμος, etc.

35. Pales, the Italian wood-goddess‚ is here united with the
Greek Apollo, as in G. 3. 2. So the Fauni and Dryades, Pan and
Silvanus, 10. 24, 26; G. 1. 11, 17, 20. For the feastyof Pale
(Palilia) see Ov. Fast. 4. 721, etc. Apollo had the title of Nomius
(νόμιος) or ‘herdsman‚' from the well-known story of Admetus in
the Alcestis of Euripides.

36, 37. In the absence of Pales and Apollo everything goes
wrong. grandia, because the largest seeds (maxima quaeque’
G. 1. 199) were chosen sor planting. infelix, ‘unkindly.' This
line recurs in G. 1. 154, with dominamur for nascuntur. According
to Pliny, N H. 18. 149, barley actually degenerated into darnel and
wild oats; a popular error, of course. The Lex Aquilia allowed an
action for damages against anyone who sowed darnel among the
corn.

38. molli. Cp. l. 31 n. Here it may mean ‘ delicate,’ in contrast
to the thistle. purpureo, perhaps ‘white’ The word is used of
any dazzling bright colom, not only of purple or red. Originally,
like πορφύρεος, it denoted a deep dark colour, as of the sea in a
storm. Horace speaks of ‘ purpureis oloribus' Od. 4. 1. 10.

39. paliurus, a common prickly shmb, called ‘Christ's thorn,’
used for quickset hedges, etc.

40. Cp. 9. 19, where ‘ florentibus herbis' seems to show that foliis
may here mean ‘ flowers’ (C.). spargite, prob. = ‘deck by plant-
