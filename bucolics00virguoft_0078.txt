NOTES TO THE ECLOGUES.

adds, ‘ay‚ the man coming up there—'tis Palaemon) voce lacessam,
‘ challenge in singing?

52, 53. si quid habes, εἴ τι λέγεις Theoc. 5. 78. quid =
anything worth hearing. quemquam, probably ‘ any umpire'3
though it may mean ‘ any opponent.’ vicine, as we say ‘ friend,' by
way of conciliating the judge.

59. alternis, sc. versibus, that is, in ‘amoebaean' style. See
introduction to this Eclogue. The Camenae were Italian nymphs
of song, later identified with the Greek Μοῦσαι. [Camena is said to
be for Camena, from the same root as carmen (sor casmenss, Car-
menta, etc„ but this etymology seems to lack proof3 at all events,
Camena is not connected with canere]

60. Some take musae as gen. sing.‚ ‘ the beginning of my song.’
Better, perhaps (as in text), Musae, vocative, as in Theoc. 17. 1 ἐκ
Διὸς ἀρχώμεσθα, καὶ ἐς Δία λήγετε, Μοῖσαι. The opening lines of
Aratus' phaenomena are ἐκ Διὸς ἀρχώμεσθα, τὸν οὐδέ ποτ’ ἄνδρες
ἐῶμεν Ι ἄρρητον· μεστοὶ δὲ Διὸς πᾶσαι μὲν ἀγυιαί, Ξ πᾶσαι δ’ ἀνθρώπων
ἀγοραί, μεστὴ δὲ θάλασσα.

61. colit, ‘inhabits‚’ said of the local presence of a deity. Cp.
2. 62; A. 1. 15. But terras means more than rura; the whole
earth, not one spot only. is Jove's dwelling-place.

62, 63. Menalcas claims the patronage of Phoebus, as the god of
poetry. The next line refers to the legends of Daphne and Hya—
cinthus, told in Ov. Met. 1. 451, etc.; 10. 162, etc, For the hiatus
in lauri et see on 1. 6; 2. 24- suave rubens, like ‘ mortale
sonans’ A. 6. 50. See also 1. 8 n., where the adj. is plural.

64. From Theoc. 5. 88 Βάλλει καὶ μάλοισι τὸν αἰπόλον ἁ Κλεαρῖστα.
Apples were sacred to Venus ; hence the eustom. Pope has imitated
this and other passages of this Eclogue in his First Pastoral.

66, 67. ignis=‘favourite.' So we say ‘ flame ' (of the object os
passion). Cp. ‘furor' 10. 38. ultro, ‘unasked’ So petere ultro,
‘to attack first,' i.e. ‘unprovoked.' These and similar meanings
come from the idea of going ‘beyond’ (ultra) what is desired or
expected. A good example is in Ter. Eun. 4. 7 (of women's
caprices) ‘Nolunt ubi velis; ubi nolis, eupiunt Μῖνα] Delia, the
name of his sweetheart. Some, less probably, refer it to the Delian
Diana, who aids him in his hunting.

69. congessere, sc. nidum, ‘ have built? For aeriae cp. 1. 57 n.
Shenstone has imitated this in the lines beginning, ‘ 1 have found out
a gift for my fair, Ι have found where the wood·pige0ns breed.’

71. From Theoc. 3. 10 ἠνίδε τοι δέκα μᾶλα φέρω, etc. aurea
refers to their colom, not to a special kind of fruit, such as citron,
quinces, or pomegranates. altera, i.e. ‘ten more.'
