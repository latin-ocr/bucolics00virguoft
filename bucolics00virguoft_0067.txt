ECLOGUE J. 21-53.

(C.). arbusta, ‘ orchards' or ‘plantations' of trees to which the
vines were trained. Arbustum is formed like virgultum, salictum,
etc. '

40, 41. neque servitio, etc., sc. alibi from next line, ‘elsewhere'
than at Rome. praesentes, ‘ready to aid.' So ‘praesentia nu-
mina’ G. 1. 10, ‘praesens divus habebitur’ Hor. Od. 1. 35. 2. Cp.
Psalm 46. 1. For the confusion between the characters of Tityrus
as a sarm slave going to buy his liberty (l. 40), and Virgil secking
the restitution of his land (1. 41), see introduction to this Eclogue.

42. iuvenem. Cp. G. 1. 500 ‘hunc iuvenem.' Octavian was
about twenty-three at this time.

43. bis senos probably indicates a monthly sacrifice. Augustus
seems to have been worshipped among the Lares. Cp. Hor. Od. 4.
5. 34 ‘Laribus tuum miscet nomen.'

44. primus==demum‚ ‘at length,' when all other means had
failed. Cp. A. 7. 118 ‘ea vox . . . prima tulit finem.’

45. submittite, ‘ rear' for breeding, ad supplendum gregem.
Cp. G. 3. 159 ‘ (vitulos) pecori submittere habendo.’ Others translate
‘ put to yoke ‘ (sc. iugo), but this is less likely.

46, 47. ergo, ‘so then‚’ in consequence of what you have told me.
et, ‘ and indeed '; i. e. poor as the land is, and with all these draw-
backs, your lot is better than mine. omnia is best taken with
pascua, as a general description of the sarm, which is partly stony
ground and partly marshland formed by the overflow of the Mincius.

49. insueta, ‘ strange‚’ i. e. unwholesome. tentabunt, ‘will try,'
i.e. poison. The verb is used of diseases, as in G. 3. 441 ‘turpis
oves tentat scabies? graves fetas, probably ‘ pregnant ewes ’;
graves: gravidas, as in A. 1. 274, etc. Others, to avoid the tauto-
logy with fetas (not necessarily an objection)‚ translate ‘sickly from
yeaning,’ comparing ‘ fetam lupam' A. 8. 630. Feta appears to be
used in both senseS‚ but it is doubtful whether graves would be
understood to mean ‘ sickly’ without some defining word, as ‘morbo’
G. 3. 95, ‘ vulnere’ Livy 21. 48.

51. flumina, the ‘streams' that seed the Mincius; cp. 1. 47 n.
The rest of the scenery, or most of it, is apparently ideal.

52. sacros, because dedicated to some nymph. Cp. Hor. Od.
1. 1. 22 ‘aut ad aquae lene caput sacrae,' Theoc. 1. 69 Ἀκιδος ἱερὸν
ὕδωρ. frigus captabis, ‘ court the cool shade.' Cp. 2. 8.

53. hinc, ‘on this side‚' opposed to hine, ‘on the other side,'
l· 56. quae semper=ut semper, ‘as it has ever done ’ς sc. suasit
srom l. 55. vicino ab limite either defines hinc (cp. ‘huc . . .
caeco lateri' A. 2. 18), or else goes with saepes, ‘the hedge on
your neighbour’s border? ab=‘ on,' denoting extension from a
