NOTES TO THE ECLOGUES.

publication. It‘ is partly modelled on the Lament for the dying
Daphnis in Theocritus' First Idyll3 that its subject was famous we
know from the testimony of Ovid (Amores Ι. 15. 30 ‘et sua cum
Gallo nota Lycoris erit,⁷ and elsewhere), and also from that of
Martial and Propertius, who all speak of the elegies of Gallus to
Lycoris in terms of high commendation.

Lines 1-3. Arethusa, a fountain in Sicily, the country of Theo—
critus, is addressed as the Muse of pastoral song. Cp. 4. Ι, 6. 1 nn.
So the dying Daphnis (Theoc. 1. 117) exclaims χαῖρ’ Ἀρέθοισα.
Cp. Milton, Lyc. 85 ‘O fountain Arethuse.’ concede, etc. (7. 22)
‘ grant me (to essay) this my last effort.' quae legat, i. e. such as may
induce Lycoris herself to read them and repent of her perfidy. neget
quis, etc. imitated in Lycidas 10 ‘ who would not sing for Lycidas? ⁹

4-6. sie . . . incipe. See on 9. 30. Here the wish is adapted to
the legend of Arethusa flying from Alpheus, related in A. 3. 694
(see Classical Dict. s. v. ARETHUSA). The poet prays that her pure
stream may keep undefiled by contact with the briny waters. (See
Shelley's Arethusa in Appendix.) Doris, as the wife of Nereus,
stands for the sea, like ‘ Nerea ' in 6. 35. sollicitos as causing
anxiety. Cp. Ov. Her. 1. 12 ‘ res est solliciti plena timoris amor.’

7, 8. simae, from Theoc. 8. 50 σιμαὶ ἔριφοι. surdis, ‘to deas
ears' (Cu) There was a proverb surdo canere. respondent, ‘ re-
echo,' with acc. of the strain repeated, like ‘ resonant ' in Ι. 5.

9-12. This form of appeal is from Theoc. Ι. 66 πᾷ ποκ’ ἄρ> ἦθ’,
ὅκα Δάφνις ἐτάκετο; etc. Virgil has in his turn been imitated by
Milton, Lyc. 50 ‘VVhere were ye, Nymphs,’ etc. Here Naiades
stand for Nymphs generally, and represent the Muses, as shown by
the mention of Parnassus3 in Theocritus they are the actual com-
panions of Daphnis. indigno, ‘ unrequited,' as in 8. 18. peribat,
not periret (see various readings), because cum simply = quo tempore.

‘at all'3 see note on ‘ quo fonte' 6. 43. Aonie, a Greek form
(’A0vi⁷7), = Boeotian3 cp. 6. 65. Aganippe was a spring on Mount
Helicon. For the scansion cp. ‘Actaeo Aracyntho ⁷ 2. 24. Virgil
makes no attempt to suit the locality of the nymphs to that in which
the scene of Gallus' sufferings is laid ; in the case of the Theocritean
Daphnis all is Sicilian, and therefore appropriate.

13-15. All Nature mourns in sympathy, as for Daphnis in 5. 25.
etiam, ‘ even,’ in contrast with the indifference of the Nymphs. For
lauri etiam cp. 3. 6 n., and for myricae 4. 2 n. The Arcadian
mountain Lycaeus was a favourite resort of Pan, G'. Ι. 16.
