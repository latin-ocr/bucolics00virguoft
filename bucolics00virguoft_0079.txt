ECLOGUE [Π. 52-84·

73. He means that Galatea’s words are fit to charm the ears of
- gods. Others take referatis, etc., to mean ‘ report them,‘ that the
gods may exact penalty in case she prove faithless. This is less
probable. ,

75. i.e. ‘ You pursue the game, and leave me to watch the netS,’
and thus we are separated in the chase. The watcher of the nets is
termed in Greek λινόπτης.

76, 77. Damoetas affects to rival Iollas, who is supposed to be
Phyllis‘ master, and also her lover (cp. l. 3). He says, ‘Send me
Phyllis on my birthday feast, you can come at another time‚' i.e. at
the Ambarvalia, a more solemn festival, from which (according to
Tibullus, 2. 1. 12) love-making was excluded. For details see Dict.
Ant. s. v. ARVALES FRATRE8; also 5. 75, G. 1. 338. faciam, sc.
sacra (so ῥέζειν = ‘sacrifice‚' Hom. ll. 2. 400, and elsewhere).
Hence vitula is abl. of instrument, ‘wilk a heifer.‘ Cp. Hor.
Od. 1. 4. 11, ‘immolare . . . agna, sive malit haedo)

79. longum, with inquit, ‘uttered a long-drawn farewell,' i.e.
prolonged her leave—taking. For vale unelided in thesi cp. 2.
65 n.

This line is variously explained. One view is that Menalcas
speaks in the character of Iollas, ‘I send you Phyllis? why, she is in
love with me !’ (C.) Another (adopted in the text) supposes
Menalcas to address Iollas, as Damoetas had just done, but in his
own person, ‘Rather send me Phyllis, for she is my love', Iollas.’
This makes a closer aud more pointed retort to Damoetas, and
accords with l. 107, where Menalcas offers to yield Phyllis to his
rival (K).

80. triste, ‘a bane,’ the neuter adj. being equivalent to a sub-
stantive. So dulce, ‘ a delight ’ (162). Other instances are ‘ varium
et mutabile semper femina ’ A. 4. 569, and Homer’s oft—quoted οὐκ
ἀγαθὸν πολυκοιρανίη Il. 2. 204.

81. irae. Cp. 2. 14 n.

82, 83. depulsiS, ‘ newly weaned,' sc. ab ubere, which is expressed
in G. 3. 187. That the arbutus was a favourite food of goats, we
{earn from G. 3. 301, Hor. Od. 1. 17. 5. saliit, cp. 1. 79. few, as
in 1. 49 (where see note), is either ‘ pregnant' or ‘ after yeaning.’

84-91. In these lines the confusion between shepherd and poet,
noticed in the introduction to Ecl. 1, is apparent. The mention of
Virgil's own patron, Pollio, and of his rivals, Bavius and Maevius, is
obviously unsuited to the characters of Damoetas and Menalcas;
especially awkward is the literary association conveyed by lectori,
⁴ reader,’ i.e. ‘ critic‚’ in the mouth of a shepherd who only sings and
plays. Once only, in Idyll 7. 40, does Theocritus, in character of
