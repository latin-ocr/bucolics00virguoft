NOTES TO THE ECLOGUES.

1111110115 strains, each in ten parts or stamas, separated by a refrain.
Each of Damon’s stanzas contains a certain order of lines, in
successive groups of 4: 3, 3, 2, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 3. Alphesiboeus observes
the same order, except that (possibly by some oversight of the poet)
his last three stanzas succeed each other in groups of 5 3, and 4 lines
5respectively.
ξ There is an introductory dedication <.11 6—13) to an unnamed
patron, who is almost certainly Pollio, now on his return from a
l successful expedition against the Parthini in Illyricum (‘ Dalmatico
tn’umpho’ Hor. Od. 2. 1. 16) in 39 Β. C.‚ the year after the ratification
l of the Brundisian treaty celebrated in the Fourth Eclogue.

Line 1. Musam, as in 1. 2. For the name Alphesiboeus see
5· 73 n.

2-4. All nature is entranced at the strain, as at Silenus’ song,
6. 27. The ‘lynxes’ are not Italian, 11111 1116 mention os Oeta in

Alc. 579 the βαλιαὶ λύγκες 111 1116 Τ11655311311 district of Pherae are
represented as charmed by Apollo's music. cursus, probably acc.
of respect with mutata, though some make it the object of re-
quierunt used transitively. The authority quoted is Prop. 3. 15. 25
‘ Iuppiter Alcmenae geminos requieverat Arctos,' but the accusative
there may express duration of time.

6, 7. tm, i. e. Pollio (see introduction). mihi, the dat. etlzicus=
‘ my friend’ or ‘ as I imagine' (K), indicating that his thoughts
went along with Pollio. superas, ‘art passing' by sea, as in
A. 1. 244 ‘fontem superare Timavi? The Timavus flows into the
Sinus Tergestinus, between Aquileia and Tergeste 111 Venetia. For
legere, ‘to eoast‚’ cp. A. 3. 392 ‘litoraque Epiri legimus.'

10. cothurno, the tragic ‘ buskin‚’ in allusion to Pollio’s tragedies.
Cp. 3. 86 11.; 3150 Hor. Od. 2. 1. 11, 12 ‘grande munus Cecropio
repetes cothumo.'

11. 3 te, etc., probably from Hom. Il. 9. 97 ἐν σοὶ μὲν λήξω, σέο
δ’ ἄρξομαι. The subject of desinet is strictly principium, but the
sense implies musa or carmen. The phrase is proverbial. [But it
is an open question whether Ribbeck's desinam, with the -am
unelided, is not the right reading. See note in various readings]
tibi, ‘for thee‚’ i. e. ‘in thy honour,’ dat. commodi, instead of the
more usual in te. In iussis (cp. 6. 9) Virgil seems to allude to
bucolic poems generally, undertaken at Pollio's request; not to the
subject of this particular Eclogue.

13. hederam, the poet's garland (7. 25 n.). The sense is ‘let the
praises a poet ean. offer mingle with your military honours.’ Pope
