VIRGIL AND THEOCRITUS. II

another as natives of Italy, Tityrus descanting to Meliboeus
on the magnificence of Rome, while in the third Eclogue
Damoetas and Menalcas contend together for the favour of
· Pollio, and in the ninth Menalcas appeals to Varus to protect
his homestead from the intrusion of Roman marauders.
Again, the fourth Eclogue invokes Sicilian Muses to celebrate
the glories of Pollio's consulship3 in the sixth the Aonian
sisterhood receive Gallus into their company, and present
him with the pastoral pipe of Hesiod by the hands of the
legendary Linus. Such a mixture of associations was sure to
occur, when once the pastoral had lost its original simplicity
and become a recognised veh-icle of poetic utterance.
Speaking of Virgil as an imitator<of Theocritus, the late
Professor Conington, in his Introduction to the Bucolics,
bids us ‘follow him line by line, and observe how constantly
he is thinking of his guide, even where a simple reliance on
nature would have been far more easy and obvious3 on
many occasions deviating from the passage before him, only
to cast a glance on some other part of his model.’ Most of
the Eclogues amply confirm this statement3 the third is a
conspicuous example. The mutual recriminations of Da-
moetas and Menalcas are copied from the fourth and fifth
Idyl]s; the proposal of a wager is partly from the eighth,
partly from the first Idyll, which also supplies the description·
of the cups offered as a prize. For the choice of an umpire
and three of the competing couplets Virgil is again indebted
to the fifth Idyll3 another couplet is taken from the third,
another from the eighth, and three more from the fifth and
fourth respectively. Besides these instances of direct imita-
tion, many turns of expression and incidental allusions are
due to various passages in Theocritus, whose poems Virgil
must have known almost by heart. Yet he never mentions
his name, any more than he does that of Hesiod in the
Georgics, but speaks only in general terms of ‘ Syracusan
verse‚’ ‘ Sicilian Muses‚' and ‘Ascraean song ' ¹. It is never-
