NOTES TO THE ECLOGUES.

Virgil appears to put the sun's formation later than the separation of
the earth from the waters (1. 37ζ; but he may not have intended
to describe the several events in their exact order. ζ On the whole
passage see Dr. Kennedy's Excursus ΙΙΙ, pp. 315—317 of his notes.)

36. rerum, ‘ objects‚‘ such as trees and animals (ll. 39, 40), which
were supposed to grow out of the earth itself. Cp Ov. Met. Ι. 88
‘ tellus induit ignotas hominum conversa figuras?

38. altius (with lucescerel, either ‘higher' than before the sepa·
ration of the sun and earth, or (with K.) ‘ at a higher elevation’ than
the clouds. [Most editors put the comma after solem3 but Virgil
does not elsewhere place atque second in its clause, and it would be
wrong to speak of ‘ rain falling from a greater height ' than before,
when no rain had previously fallen] summotis, ‘uplifted’ above
the earth, but between it and the sun.

40. rara, ‘here and there' (cp. 5. 7), or perhaps ‘ one by one‘
(C.) ignaros is more poetical than the common reading ignotos, as
personifying the mountains, which are said ‘ not to know ' the strange
visitors.

41—81. For the details of all the following stories see Classical
Dictionary. Silenus proceeds to relate (but in reversed order) the
earliest legends of the human race, viz. those of Deucalion and
Pyrrha, the golden age of Saturn, the crime of Prometheus and its
punishment.

42. Caucasias volueres, the eagle (or vulture), αἰετὸν τανύπτερον
Hes. Theog. 523, sent to torment Prometheus. The tale of Pyrrha
and Deucalion is told at length by Ovid, Μεί. 318-415. For the
plural volucres cp. Propert. 4. 25. 14 ‘Caucasias etiam si patere-
mur aves.

43, 44. Next‚ the tale of Hylas the favourite of Hercules, ravished
by the Naiads for his beauty. See Theoc. 13th Idyll. quo fonte, etc.
z‘ how left behind at the spring for Hylas the sailors shouted.’ Cp.
‘ quo cursu,' ‘ quibus alis‚' ll. 80, 81, where the quo and quibus are in
sense adverbial.

Hyla Hyla. For the long vowel unelided in arsis cp. 2. 24. 3. 6,
8. 44 ; for short vowel in tlzesz's cp. 2. 65, 3. 79, 8. 108.

45-60. Next he relates at some length the story of Pasiphae and
her monstrous passion for a bull. The other stories are dismissed
with a brief allusion (ll. 61—81).

46, 47. solatur, i. e. sings how Pasiphae solaced herself with
love. Cp. ‘ circumdat,' ‘erigit,' ll. 62, 63. virgo, of a married
woman, as in Hor. Od. 2. 8. 22 ‘virgines nuptae? Pasiphae was
the wife of Minos.
