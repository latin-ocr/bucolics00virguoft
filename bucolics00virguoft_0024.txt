20 VARIOUS READINGS

spurious. It is however worth while to notice Dr. Kennedy’s
conjecture experiatur (with haut for aut) ; but see note.

Ecl. iv, 1. 52. laetantur, Rom.; so Heyne‚ Wagner, Forbiger and
Conington. Other MSS. have laetentur, probably from an idea
that the subjunctive was required after ‘ aspice ut.’

1. 53. Several good MSS. read tum for tam, i.e. when the child
has reached maturity. It is hard to decide, and the differenee
between a and u is very slight. The longe of one or two MSS.
is probably an error, as longe (in the positive) is not used to
denote time.

1. 55. The MSS. vary between vincat and vincet. P. has a
corrected to e, Ribbeck retains vincat. Either may stand, but the
pres. subj. corresponds better with maneat.

Ecl. v,1. 3. consedimus, Ribbeck from most MSS. But, as C.
observes, the present considimus is more usual and confusion
between ἱ and e is easy. The perfect, however, is possible (see
note). Α

1. 52. Daphnim in P. adopted by Ribbeck and some others. The
acc. in —z‘m (as Alexim, Moerim, etc.) uniformly occurS, but
it is a question whether Virgil would have ventured to keep the
-z'm unelided, especially where there is no pause in the verse. See
below on 8. 11.

Ecl. vi, 1. 37. The pointing in the text, adopted by Wagner, Coning-
ton, etc., is perhaps preferable to that of most editions, in which the
comma follows solem. See note. R. reads utque for atque.

1. 51. quaesissent, Ribbeck from P.‚ but it is doubtless a tran-
scriber’s error.

l. 80. Ribbeck’s conjecture alte is unnecessary, though there is
a slight ambiguity about ante (see note).

1. 85. The best MSS. read referri, altered from referre, which looks
like a correction to suit cogere preceding <see note).

Ecl. vii, 1. 48. lento (for laeto), Ribbeck and Ladewig (Schafer) from
P. and M. (corrected), but the sense is not clear. Both lentus
and laetus were often written as letus, hence the confusion. The
latter, meaning ‘ luxuriant‚’ is a special epithet of the vine, as in G.
2. 262 ‘laetum vitis genus.’

l. 54. quaque, Heyne, Wagner, and Forbiger‚ from a conjecture of
Heinsius. But quaeque may stand (see note).

Ecl. viii, l. 11. The reading desinam adopted by Ribbeck from P.
