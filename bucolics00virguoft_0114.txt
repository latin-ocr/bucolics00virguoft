NOTES TO THE ECLOGUES.'

of subducere, e. g. in Hor. Sat. 1. 2. 2 5 where however ‘ subductis
tunicis ’ is contrasted with ‘ demissis.' Here it is simpler to regard
both verbs from the same point of view—‘ to sink, and let down
their ridges by a gentle slope.’ fracta cacumina, in apposition
with fagos. Cp. 2. 3 n. Menalcas represents Virgil himself ; see
introduction to Eclogue3 also for the scenery here indicated.

13-15. ChaoniaS, a ‘literary' epithet (see on 1. 54), from the
Chaones in Epirus, where was the oracle of Dodona, said to have
been founded in consequence of a command brought by doves from
Libya, Hdt. 2. 55, 56. quacumque, etc.‚ ‘to cut short the dis-
pute on any terms’ or ‘ at any sacrifice’3 sc. ratione, and cp. ‘ in-
cidere sermonem' Liv. 32. 37. sinistra implies that the omen was
certain, as well as a warning of misfortune. Cp. Cic. de Div. 1. 39
‘ cornix a sinistra facit ratum?

17—20. cadit in, ‘ attaches to'; i. e. ‘could any one commit
such a crime ‘?⁷ tua solatia, ‘ the solace of thy songs,’ specimens
of which are quoted. In spargeret, etc.‚ there is a direct reference
to 5. 40, where see note. Observe also the variations of construc-
tion with inducere, ‘ fontes umbra’ here and ‘ fontibus umbras ' l. c.

21, 22. vel quae, etc.‚ se. quis caneret. sublegi, ‘ I stole.'
For sub=‘ secretly’ cp. 3. 6 n. So ὑπό in ὑπάγειν, ὑποπέμπειν, etc.
tibi, probably Menalcas, who is addressed in l. 17. delicias,
4· darling'3 cp. 2. 2 n. For meaning of Amaryllis see on Ι. 5.

23—25. A rather close rendering of Theocr. 3. 3 Τίτυρ’ ἐμὶν τὸ
καλὸν πεφιλαμένε, βόσκε τὰς αἶγας, etc. It is doubted whether this
and the following specimens are isolated fragments of poetry, com-
posed for the purpose of this Eclogue, or portions of unpublished
Eclogues, more or less incomplete. dum redeo, lit. ‘ while Ι am
on my way back,' but practically=‘ till my return’ (dum rediero).
Cp. Ter. Adelphz· 2. 1 ‘ delibera hoc, dum rede0.' inter agendum
=‘ dum agis? occursare, inf. for the usual ne with subj. after caveto.
Cp. Hor. A. P. 168 ⁶ commisisse cavet‚' also (in prose) Cic. ad Att.
3. 17 ⁶ cave vereri.' Sallust has this construction occasionally.

26-29. immo (μὲν οὖν), ‘nay rather,’ drawing attention to the lines
composed for Varus, the successor of Pollio in Cisalpine Gaul. See
introduction to Ecl. 6. necdum (οὐδέπω), ‘and not finished either?
superet= superszt, as in A. 5. 519 ‘solus superabat Acestes?
nimium vicina. Though Mantua had adhered to Caesar's party,
much of its territory had been taken to supply the deficiency 1n that
of Cremona, which had sided with Brutus. cycni 3 see 8. 56 n.
The Mincius was famous for its swans; cp. G. 2. 198

‘ Et qualem infelix amisit Mantua eampum
pascentem niveos herboso flumine cycnos]
