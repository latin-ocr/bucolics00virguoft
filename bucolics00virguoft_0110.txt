NOTES TO THE ECLOGUES.

by Circe see Hom. Od. 10. 203, etc. Ulixi (-ez') gen. of Ulixb‘zZs,
the Latin form of Οὐλιξεύς, Doric sor Ὀδυσσεύς. So Achilli in
A. 1. 30 and elsewhere. rumpitur, ‘is burst asunder,' another sup-
posed effect of magic. Cp. Ov. Amor. 2. 1. 25 ‘carmine dissiliunt
abruptis faucibus angues.’

74-76. terna, probably not distributive here or in 1. 78, though
some understand nine < 3 >< 3) threads of three colours‚ white, red, and
black. tibi, ‘round thee,' i.e. thy image. numero impare. An un-
even number, being indivisible into two equal partS‚ was held to be
sacred and immortal (F orb.). We have still a common superstition
about there being ‘ luck in odd numbers.’ With the whole passage
compare Dido’s incantation in A. 4. 509, etc., also that of Medea in
Ov. Met. 7. 192, etc.

79. modo, in urgent commands=‘ just‚' like nurin German. Cp.
‘i modo’ Plaut. T rin. 2. 4. Veneris, etc., i.e. true ‘love-knots’
to bind him to her.

81, 82. limus and cera may be images representing Daphnis; but
as no images are mentioned in the corresponding passage of Theocr.
2. 28, it is possible that only lumps of clay and wax are intended here.
The object was to harden his heart towards others, and soften it
towards her. For {odem cp. 7. 54 n.. A. 10. 487 ‘ una eademque
via,’ Propert. 5. 57 ‘ eosdem oculos.’

83, 84. molam, ἄλφιτα in Theocr. 2. 18. The salted meal used
in sacrifices, ‘ salsae fruges ' A. 2. 133. fragiles, ‘ crackling’; cp.
Lucr. 6. 112 ‘fragiles sonitus chartarum? in Daphnide, ‘for the
bane of Daphnis ’ (K). Cp. Theocr. 2. 23 Δελφῖς ἔμ’ ἀνίασεν, ἐγὼ
δ’ ἐπὶ Δελφὶδι δάφναν 1 αἵθω. As the bay leaves were consumed in
the fire, so might Daphnis waste away.

86. Daphnim, sc. teneat from l. 90.

88, 89. propter, ‘ beside‚' as in G. 3. 14 ‘propter aquam.' per-
dita, ‘distracted.’ decedere nocti, ‘to retire before (at command
of) night,' nearly repeated in G. 3. 457. Virgil is said to have
transferred this passage from a poem by Varius (see note on 9. 35),
but in an improved form.

92—94. exuvias, ‘relics,' i. e. clothes put'off and left behind.
These she considers as a ‘pledge' (pignora) of his return. In A. 4. 49 5
Dido burns the exuviae of Aeneasfor a different purpose. The en—
chantress in Theocr. 2. 53 burns a fringe of her lover’s robe and
buries magic drugs under his threshold. debent, etc. =‘ are bound
to bring Daphnis back‚’ but ducere need not be supplied. The same
construction occurs in Hor. Od. 1. 3. 6 ‘navis quae . . . debes Ver-
gilium.'

96, 97. herbas atque venena, probably a hendiadys = ‘ poisonous
