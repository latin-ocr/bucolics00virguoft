ΛΝΒ EMENDATJONS. 21

is very likely right, though I have retained, with some hesitation,
the usual desinet. Cp. Daphnim (or Daphnin) 5. 52, also
‘num adest’ Hor. Sat. 2. 2. 28. Here the full stop makes the
non-elision of ·am less objectionable. The Ist person is also
slightly supported by ἄρξομαι in Virgil's supposed original,
quoted in the note.

1. 20. adloquar (for adloquor), Ribbeck from the original reading
in P. and M. The difference is slight and unimportant.

ll. 48—51. Ribbeck writes ‘manus‚ crudelis! tu quoque, mater,
Crudelis mater! magis et puer improbus ille (omitting l. 51).
The alteration is needless3 the received text has a certain awk-
wardness, but is not necessarily corrupt or interpolated.

1. 59. Most editions have fiant ; but fiat, adopted by Ribbeck and
Conington from P. and M. may be right. Cp. Ov. Met. 1. 292
‘ omnia pontus erat?

Eel. ix, l. 9. The reading veteres fagos, restored by Heinsius and
Burmann from M. for veteris sagi in P. and other MSS. is doubt·
less right.

l. 42. Ribbeck's conjecture en (for et) is without authority.

Eel. x, 1. 1. laborum, the original reading of 12., corrected to la-
borem, is clearly erroneous. Ribbeck, however, adopts it.

l. 10. M. (originally) and several other MSS. read periret, but
peribat has the best authority and is grammatically correct (see
note).

1. 12. Ribbeck reads Aoniae from M. aud R., but the Greek form
Aonie in P. and some others is more likely. As ae is often
written e, confusion is inevitable.

. 17 is omitted by Ribbeck as spurious.

1. 19. upilio, a variant form of opilio, is found in some MSS. See
note on the derivation.

Ribbeck marks the loss of a line after 1. 41 and 1. 46.
