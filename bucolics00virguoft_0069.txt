ECLOGUE J. 54-73.

dus, cupidus, etc.,=tz'mens, cupiens, etc. Forbiger and others (in-
cluding Conington) adopt the common reading Cretae, i. e. ‘the
swift Oaxes of Crete.' The objections, as stated by Dr. Kennedy‚
are mainly these. (Ι) There is no proper evidence of a river Oaxes
existing in Crete, though a town Axos (appearing on coins as Oaxos)
is mentioned by Herodotus, 4. 154. (2) We require a river in the
extreme East to match the other three extreme points, Africa, Scythia,
and Britain. (3) The epithet rapidum is ill-suited to what must,
if existing, have been a petty stream. This last objection is not
insuperable, rapidum being a stock epithet οἱ rivers; the other two,
especially the first, must be allowed to have great weight. It is also
urged that ‘Cretae Oaxen,’ with amnem omitted, is not a Latin
phrase ; it accords however with Greek idiom, which Virgil is in
other instances fond of imitating. Reading then cretae, we may
suppose Oaxen to be a variant form of Oxum, a river on the con-
fines of Bactria, described by Curtius as ‘turbidus semper.’ The
change of form may have been made in the analogy of the well-
known Araxes, and the reading Araxen has been suggested here.
Possibly virgil wrote Oaxum, or even ad Oxum, which Ladewig has
adopted.

66. penitus, ‘entirely.’ toto orbe, either ‘from the whole
world,' in reference to its isolated position ζ Hor. Od. 1. 35. 29);
or ‘ by the whole world,' i.e. from the Oaxes (Oxus). Cp. Ov. Epist.
ex Ponto, Ι. 9, 48 ‘ toto dividor orbe ' (K.) This of course depends
on the reading ofl. 65.

67. en, of strong emotion,=‘ ah 1’ or ‘ah well!’ Cp. 8. 73 A. 4.
534 ‘ en quid ago ?'

69. post, ‘ hereafter,' a resumption of ‘longo post tempore?
aristas is best taken after mirabor, fines and eulmen after videns,
with mea regna in apposition to the latter word—‘ shall I ever on
beholding my native borders and the turs—thatched roof of the poor
hut, my former domain, gaze hereafter with wonder on a few ears of

coms—the result of neglect and bad fal-ming on the part of the Ν

invaders. Others take all four accusatives in apposition after videns
mirabor, ‘ shall Ι see with wonder.’

70. impius, ‘ruffian ' or ‘ lawless ’ (l. 12). novalia, properly
either ‘ fallows ' or land ploughed for the first time, but here ‘ lands '
generally (Q).
