NOTES TO THE ECLOGUES.

his Introduction to the Eclogues, between ‘the enfranchised slave
and the poet secured in his farm ἐ hardly, we think, cleared by
the hypothesis that the one incident ‘ symbolises’ the other, since
the language of 1. 42 plainly describes this interview with Octavian
as an incident merely of the visit of Tityrus to Rome, its avowed
object being to purchase his freedom. This difficulty might have
been avoided, had Virgil chosen‚ in the assumed character of
Tityrus, to reproduce the actual circumstances of his own visit to
the capital, and the consequent restoration of his estate. As it is,
he has pushed the allegory too far, and the confusion cannot well be·
got over.

The scenery is chiefly borrowed from the Sicily of Theocritus,
Neither hills nor rocks, beeches, chestnuts, or pines are found in the
level plain that surrounds Mantua. The marshy lake (l. 48), formed
by the overflow of the Mincius, is perhaps the only real feature
in the description.

Line 1. The names Tityrus and Amaryllis (l. 5) are taken
from the third Idyll of Theocritus. Τι’τυρος is said to be a Doric form
of Σάτυρος. Cp. Aelian‚ Var. Hz'st. 3. 40 Σάτυροι, οἱ ὑπ’ ἐνίων
Τὶτυροι ὀνομαζόμενοι. Amaryllis, from ἀμαρῦσσειν, ‘to sparkle,⁷
probably means ‘bright—eyed.’

2. Cp. 6. 8 ‘Agrestem tenui meditabor harundine musam‚’ also
‘ silvestrem . . . fundere musam ’ Lucr. 4. 589. meditaris, ‘ study,'
‘practise.' Not (probably) by change of lto d from μελετᾶν, but
from the root med· in med-eri, etc., cognate with μαθ-εΐν, μήδ-εσθαι.
Milton, Lycidas 66, has imitated this line by an over—literal render-
ing, ‘ meditate the thankless Muse’ Cp. Hor. Epist. 2. 2. 76
‘ versus meditare canor05.’ avena, ‘ pipe‚’ lit. of oats, but whether so
trivial an instrument was ever seriously employed may well be doubted.
The word may mean any hollow stem or reed (e. g. of the flax-plant.
Plin. N. H. 19. Ι), and is equivalent to the calamus, harundo, etc„
elsewhere mentioned. Hence the ‘ oaten pipe ' carne to be the repre-
sentative instrument of pastoral music. Cp. Spenser‚ Shep. Cal. 1.
72; Milton, Lyc. 33, 88.

4, 5. fugimus, ‘are exiled from.' So φεύγειν, with or without
πατρίδος expressed. lentus, ‘stretched at ease‚’ a shortened parti-
cipial form from stem of len-is. It means (Ι) ‘supple‚’ ‘pliant‚'
1. 26; (2) of limbs ‘relaxed‚' hence at ease;’ (3) ‘slow‚' of rivers,
etc„ as ‘lento marmore’ A. 7. 28. formosam with resonare, ‘to
ring with (the praises of) Amaryllis’ beauty.’

6. deus, i. e. Octavianus, for whom Virgil anticipates divine
honours. These were not actually paid to the emperor till 29 B. C.‚
