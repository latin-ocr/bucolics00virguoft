NOTES TO THE ECLOGUES.

Simichidas‚ compare himself with actual poets of the day, Ascle-
piades and Philetas, by name. See Introduction, p. 10.

85. vitulam and taurum (l. 86‘4y are either intended as sacrifices
in Pollio's honour, or (as C. thinks) prizes for different kinds of
poetry. pascite, ‘ fatten)

86, 87. nova is variously explained as ‘ originaL' or ‘ ever fresh,’
or as referring to a new kind of poetry, hitherto untried at Rome.
Pollio is praised as a tragic poet by Horace, Od. 2. 1. 11 ‘grande
munus Cecropio repetes cothurno? Catullus, 12. 8, calls him ‘ lepo-
rum disertus puer ac facetiarum?

Virgil by elision avoids shortening the 0 in Pollio. Horace ven-
tures upon the licence in Od. 2. 1. 4 ‘ et consulenti, Pollia curiae.’

qui petat, etc. The subj. denotes quality, not purpose, i. e. one
that is just old enough to begin butting, ete. Cp. Pope, Past. Ι. 48
‘ that threats a fight and spurns the rising sand.’

88, 89. te gaudet, sc. venisse3 i. e. ‘ may Pollio's admirers reach
the height that he also has attained, and enjoy with him his blissful
state) The allusion is to the fabled paradise of eminent poets,
where (as in the golden age, 4. 25, 30) nature’s choicest products
flow in abundance. amomum is some Oriental spice-tree not pre-
cisely known.

For veniat quo, etc. ep. Theoc. 1. 20 καὶ τᾶς βωκολικᾶς ἐπὶ τὸ
πλέον ἵκεο Μώσας.

90, 91. ‘ On the other hand may admirers of Bavius and Maevius
lose their pains, like one who should harness foxes to the plough and
try to milk he-goats.’ Lucian, Demonax 28, makes τράγον ἀμέλγειν
a synonym for fruitless labour.

Bavius and Maevius were bad poets of the day, and possibly
detractors of Virgil. The latter is execrated by Horace, Epod. 10.
Ι, 2 as ‘ olentem Maevium.'

93. The distracted order of the words frigidus. .anguis ex
presses perturbation. There 1s a notable instance in A. 9. 427, where
the agonised Nisus exclaims‘ me, me, -adsum qui feci—in me con-
vertite ferrum?

94, 95. Partly from Theoc. 5. 100. parcite=n0lzffta do not,’ etc.
Cp. A. 3. 42 ‘parce pias scelerare manus.' ipse arieS, ‘even the
ram,' the leader of the flock, who might have known better.

96. reice, contr. from reice=rei2'ce. Compounds of z'acz‘o were
often spelt with a single z· (rez‘cz'o, eicio, etc. in Lucretius, Plautus,
etc).

97. Cp. Theoc. 5. 145 αὔριον ὔμμε Ι πᾶσας ἐγὼ λουσῶ Συβαρίτιδος
ἔνδοθι κράνος. cogite, sc. in umbram. In G. 3. 331 virgil gives
directions for taking flocks into the shade at noon, and letting
