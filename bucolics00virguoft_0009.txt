INTRODUCTION.

Titles of the poems. Early life of Virgil. Origin and rise of
Pastoral poetry. The ‘Muse of Sicily' developed by virgil. How
far was he an orzgn‘nal poet? The rise, progress, and decline of
modern Pastoral. Publication of the Eclogues. MSS. and principal
Editions. Various readings and critical remarks.

THE earliest descriptive title by which the following poems
were known was Bucolica, or Songs of Herdsmen (βουκόλοι) ;

hence, by extension of meaning, poems on country life, in
λ which shepherds and husbandmen and other rustic char-
acters play their respective parts. The name, if any, which
Virgil himself gave to these early essays in verse is un-
known: their alternative title Eclogae seems to mean
⁶ selections ' (ἐκλογαί) from a number of pieces on a similar
subject 1, now published in a collected form. At what time
and on what occasions these Eclogues were severally
written will appear from the following sketch of the poet’s
life, down to the year 37 Β. C. when the tenth and last poem of
the series was completed.

Our chief source of information is the Life of Virgil
ascribed to Aelius Donatus, a grammarian of the fourth
century A. D., but almost certainly the work of Suetonius ²
early in the second century. There is also afragment of a Life
by Valerius Probus, of the first century, which is of little ad-
ditional value. Both these seem to have been drawn from

¹ Or possibly ‘ selected passages' for imitation, studies &so to
speak) from the Greek poets, especially Theocritus.
