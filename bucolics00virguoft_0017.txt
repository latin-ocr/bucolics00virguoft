MODERN PASTORAL POETR Y. 13

be recorded ; an Eclogue by the Venerable Bede (about
700 A. D.) entitled C aculus, a contest in verse between VVinter
and Spring concerning the appearance of the cuckoo‚ de-
serves a passing notice.

The earliest modern pastorals are the French pastourelles,
· in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries A. D., which were love
dialogues in verse spoken alternately. Twelve Latin Eclogues
by Petrarch appeared in 1350, and others by Mantuan in
1402; these last were much admired and taught in schools
more than a century later. Portuguese and Spanish pastoral
romances were produced about the same time, or even earlier,
but the Italians, whose language was better known, made
this kind of composition fashionable in Europe ¹. Hence the
fashion passed into England; the earliest English pastorals
being Barclay’s Eclogzces (1514) modelled upon Petrarch and
Mantuan. During the reign of Elizabeth the rage for pastoral
was at its height ; this was principally owing to the numerous
translations of the Greek and Latin Classics produced at
this time. With the pagan and Italian fictions Gothic ro-

mance was incorporated, and the refined language of cour· ·

tiers and feudal knights was adopted, most incongruously,
by characters in the guise of plain shepherds. Spenser in
his Shepheard's Calendar (1579) attempted to restore to the
pastoral something of its original rusticity, but with only
partial success; for the uncouth language of his swains
(unlike the native Doric of Theocritus) is unnatural, and to
modern ears often repulsive. Early in the seventeenth century
appeared Fletcher's Faz'llzful Shepherdess, Browne’s Britan-

nz'a's Pastorals, and the Sad Shepherd of Jonson. In 1634 ‘

Milton, by his masques of Arcades and Comus, made an
effort toward purifying the pastoral drama from the licen-
tiousness by which many of its specimens had been dis-

¹ sannazaro's Arcadia appeared in 1502, his Latin Pz'scatory
Eclogues in 1520. The first complete pastoral drama is Beccari's
Il Sagrzfizz‘o (1554). Tasso’s Amz'nta and Guarini's Pastor Fido
are dated 1580 and 1585 respectively.
