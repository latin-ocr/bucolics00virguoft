NOTES TO THE ECLOGUES.

The allusion is to the hyacinth‚ ‘that sanguine flower inscribed -
=— with woe ' (Milton, Lyc. 116), which bears marks supposed to repre-
sent the letters AI AI. These were interpreted as emblems
of Apollo's lament over Hyacinthus, whom he had accident-
ally slain, (Ov. Met. 10. 215), or, according to another legend, as the
initial letters of Aias, from whose blood the same flower was en-
gendered (ib. 13. 398). regum will apply either to Ajax as a famous
chieftain, or to Hyacinthus who was a king's son. Cp. Moschus,
Epz‘t. Bionis 6 νῦν, ὑάκινθε, λάλει τὰ σὰ γράμματα, καὶ πλέον αἲ αἶ l
βάμβαλε σοῖς πετάλοισι.

109,11Ο. et quisquis, etc. According to the text the meaning
is ‘whoever (like you) shall either sear love's sweets or taste its bitters,'
i.e. whoever has had such experience of love, as to have felt ‘the
alarm that attends its enjoyment or the pangs of disappointment'(C.).
There may be a special reference to l. 81, where Damoetas de-
precates Amaryllis' anger, and to 1. 75, where Menalcas upbraids
Amyntas for deserting his company. Ribbeck and Forbiger alter the
text to ‘ haut (haud) . . . haut,' with a full stop after hic, i. e. ‘ who-
ever shall not fear love’s sweets shall never taste its bitters.’ [Dr.
Kennedy suggests ‘haud metuet, dulces aut experialur amaros‚’ i. e.
‘ whether he find them sweet or bitter'; but it is doubtful whether
aut can be thus used for sive, ‘whether . . . 0r‚’ and no parallel
instances are cited]

111. rivos, ‘sluices' for watering the fields. Cp. G. 1. 106.
There may also be, as Conington suggests, a figurative allusion to the
streams of bucolic verse, which it is now time to close.

FOUR'I'H ECLOGUE.

IN the year 40 B. C. Octavianus and Antony became reconciled by
the Treaty of Brundisium through the agency of Maecenas, aided by
C. Asinius Pollio, to whom this Eclogue is addressed. The general
expectation of a ‘ golden age ’ of peace and prosperity, fostered partly
by tradition, partly by ‘ Sibylline' prophecies then current (l. 4 n.),
was now to be sulfilled, and was connected in men's minds with the
birth of a·child in the year os Pollio's consulship. Who was this
child? Some have suggested the son of Antony, by whose marriage
with Octavia the Brundisian Treaty was ratified. This is in itself
improbable, and is negatived by the fact that any offspring of Octavia
in that year must have been the child os her former husband Mar-
cellus. All ancient tradition points to a son of Pollio himself,
C. Asinius Gallus, who is said on good authority to have claimed
