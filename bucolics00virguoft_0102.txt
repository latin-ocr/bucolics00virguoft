NOTES TO THE ECLOGUES.

stupidity, and the conventional associations of Arcadia with bucolic
poetry are probably due to Virgil and his successors (C. and Kt.).
eantare=cantando, with pares (cp. 5. 1, 2), ‘equally matched in
singing and (both) ready to reply in an amoebaean contest.’ [C. and
others take parati with both verbs, ‘ ready either to take the first
part (eantare) or the second (respondere) in a match (pares).'
This is a possible but less obvious and simple construction. Schra-
der reads periti (cp. 10. 32), which is nearer to Theoc. 8. 4 ἄμφω
συρῖσδεν δεδαημὲνω ἄμφω demea]

6. For dum with pres. implying past time, followed by a pluperf.,
cp. A. 6. 171 ‘ dum personat aequora . . . Triton immerserat unda.'
frigore, ‘ the spring frosts,' the myrtle being a tender plant.

7. From Theoc. 8. 49 ὦ τράγε, τᾶν λευκᾶν αἷγᾶν ἄνερ. For ipse
cp. 3. 95 n. deeraverat, a common contracdon, especially in
afferat (desum), Ov. Met. 1. 77 and elsewhere. atque=‘when,’
marking a close sequence of events. Cp. Α. 3. 9 ‘vix prima in-
ceperat aestas, et pater Anchises dare fatis vela iubebat.’

10. cessare, ‘get leisure’=0tz·arz·. Cp. Propert. 3. 23. 15
‘ cessabimus una.'

11-13. ipsi=ultr0, asin 4. 21 ; 6. 26. tenera, etc.‚ repeated in
G. 3. 15· For the river scenery about Mantua see on 1. 48. prae-
texit, aorist of permanence=‘ here is Mincius fringing his banks’
(Q). sacra, i. e. to Juppiter. Cp. Theoc. 5. 46 ὧδε καλὸν βομ-
βεῦντι ποτὶ σμήνεσσι μέλισσαι.

14-16. Alcippe and Phyllis are mates or partners of other shep-
herds. See on 1. 31. For depulsos cp. 3. 82 n. Corydon eum
Thyrside is in virtual apposition with certamen, ‘ a grand match,
Corydon against Thyrsis.'

19. alternos, etc.‚ lit. ‘their Muses willed to remember (record)
alternate (amoebaean) verses.’ Cp. 3. 59. The Muses, as daughters
of Mnemosyne (Memory), were said to recal to the minds of their
votaries what they had to utter. Hence poetical composition is
represented as an act of memory. Cp. A. 7. 645 ‘et meministis
enim, Musae, et memorare potestis. ‘ In what follows Th) rsis' choiee
of subjects is generally less pleasing than that of Cory don; his im·
agery is osten ungraceful and his language rude and sometimes ³
offensive (l. 26). In the last two quatrains there is perhaps little
difference between the two competitors‚ but the balance is obviously
in Corydon's favour.

21, 22. Libethrides, of Libethrus‚ a spring in or near Mount
Helicon. Its nymphs‚ equally with the Muses, were inspirers of
song. Codro, probably an imaginary person, as in 5. 11, where see
note. proxima, sc. carmina, ‘ second to Phoebus only.’
