NOTES TO THE ECLOGUES.

lary g0d; but even so, Virgil will not shun the contest.

- 60. risu, ‘with a smile,’ the child's, not the mother's, ‘by her
smile.’ The infant at his birth is bidden to smile‚ which was in
itself a good omen, and would induce the mother to smile in return.
Hence eui non risere parentes l. 62.

child.

62, 63. The child whom its parents love not (of which love their
smile is the expression) can never come to honour. In the present in·
stanee this honour is to enjoy the society of gods and heroes, ex-
pressed by sharing the table of Jove and marrying a goddess. This
is from Hom. Od. 11. 602, where it is said of Heracles‚ μετ’ ἀθανά-
τοισι θεοῖσι Ι τέρπεται ἐν θαλίῃς καὶ ἔχει καλλίσφυρον Ἥβην.

FIF'I'H EGLOGUE.

IN this Eclogue two shepherds agree to play and sing together.
Mopsus, invited by Menalcas, begins with a lament for the deceased
hero Daphnis (ll. 20—44) 3 Menalcas then sings how he was raised to
the rank of a god in heaven [11. 56-80). After mutual compliments
they exchange presents.

The Eclogue, as shown by ll. 86, 87, was written after the second
and third; its probable date is B.C. 42. It is of the ‘amoebaean‘
kind described in the introduction to Ecl. 33 but here each shep-
herd sings a continuous strain of twenty-five lines. There is no
avowed rivalry, and no singing for a prize. The subject is suggested
by Theocritus' First Idyll, which relates the death of Daphnis;
Virgil celebrates his apotheosis, and so completes the theme.

Among the interpreters of this poem, both ancient and modern,
many have thought that in Daphnis Virgil referred to Julius Caesar,
who had been assassinated B. C. 44 and to whom divine honours were
decreed in the following year. This is probable, not only from
the known attachment of our poet to Caesar's cause and party, but
from certain allusions in the Eclogue itself, which seem to point in
the same direction. These are (Ι) the story told by Suetonius that
certain horses which Caesar had consecrated and let loose at the pas-
sage of the Rubicon, refused to seed and wept copiously gl. 26); this
was regarded as a sign of his approaching death: (2) Daphnis teach·
ing the swains to celebrate Bacchic rites kl· 30), in connexion with
Caesar’s introduction of the Liberalia at Rome: (3) the dream of
Caesar, also related by Suetonius, and referred to in the note on
