NOTES TO THE ECLOGUES.

Lines 1-3. sicelides=‘pastoral‚’ from the Sicilian Theocritus.
Cp. 6. 1. So Bion and Moschus speak of Σικελὸν μέλος and Σικελικαὶ
Μοῖσαι in the same connexion. maiora. Cp. Milton, Lyc. 87
‘ that strain I heard was of a higher meod? The humiles myricae,
‘tamarisks’ (Theoc. 1. 13), are symbols of common rural poetry.
Cp. 6. 10. silvas means that the theme is still pastoral, but ele-
vated for this occasion (see introd. ad fin)

4, 5. Cumaei, strictly Cymaei, from Κυμαῖος, the true Latin
adj. being Cumanus. The Sibyl of Cumae in Campania (A. 3.
441; 6. 2, 41, etc.) was in high repute. These Sibyls were
originally Asiatic‚ and passed into Italy at an early date. Many
Sibylline prophecies were current, often forged on occasions, espe-
cially now that the civil wars were over and better times eagerly
expected. One of these oracles seems to have predicted that after a
long series of ages (saecula) a new order should begin. The last
age of the old cycle is now supposed to be in progress. With this
theory Virgil combines that of a Magnus Annus, a period of vast
length, at the end of which all the planets should occupy the same
position as at the creation, and history should recommence (l. 34).
This great year, like ordinary years, had its divisions of months and
days relative to its length; hence ‘magni menses' 1. 12. ab in·
aegro, ‘anew.' The e is usually short: but cp. Lucr. 1. 296 ‘in-
tegros accedere fontes,' Hor. Sat. 2. 2. 113 ‘integris opibus.'

6. et, ‘ both,’ since redeuntza second et. Cp. A. 8. 91 ‘ miran—
tur et undae3 Miratur nemus? virgo, Astraea or Justice, the last
to leave the earth under the iron age. Cp. G. 2. 474, Ov. Met. 1.
151. The ‘reign of saturn ’ was the golden age of innocence. Cp.
3. 89. nova progenies (1. 7) refers to this new age, not to the
expected child.

8. quo, ‘under whom' (at whose birth) or ‘by whose agency’
(as leader). The reference is probably to Hesiod's five ages (Opp.
109-201 ), of which the iron age was the last and worst. According
to Servius, the Sibylline oracies made ten ages, each with its presiding
deity, the last being that of the Sun-god or Apollo (1. ιο).

10. Lucina here=Diana (Aprem Εἰλειθυΐα), sister of Apollo;
hence tuus. The Roman birth-goddess was usually Juno Lucina.

11. teque adeo, etc„ ‘in thy consulship, even thine.' Adeo is
commonly used for emphasis with pronouns. Cp. ‘tuque adeo?
‘thou above all,' G. 1. 24 (also ‘usque adeo' 1. 12). decus prob-
ably refers to the child, who is to be the ‘ glory of his age.’ inibit
:inibit vitam. But many understand decus aevi as a Greek
iai0m=decorum aevum, ‘this glorious age ' (like ‘ miracula rerum,'
‘ strata viarum,' etc.). In that case inibit must mean ‘ will begin.'
