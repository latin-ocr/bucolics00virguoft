ECLOGUE [Η. 85-106.

them out again to graze in the 0001 of the evening. praeceperit,
‘ catches,' i. e. ‘dries up before' milking time, or ‘ before' we can
prevent it.

100. Cp. Theoc. 4. 20 λεπτὸς μὰν χώ ταῦρος ὃ πύρριχος. ervo is
some kind of ‘ vetch.' ,

102, 103. hjs, sc. agnis, i. e. ⁶ my lambs don't suffer :from love—
so lean are they—’tis some evil eye that blights them.' neque, ac-
cording to Voss, Conington, etc.=ne quidem (οὐδέ), ‘not even so
simple a malady as love‚’ etc. This sense of neque occurs in later
writers ; here it may possibly mean ‘ hut not,’ as in Livy and Sallust, or
simply—:nom according to primitive usage. [Another suggested
reading is ‘ lzz‘ certe, neque amor causa est, vix ossibus haerent,' the
clause neque to est being parenthetical.]

The superstition about the ‘ evil eye ’ (βασκαίνειν) was almost uni-
versal. Cp. Hor. Epist. 1. 14. 37 ‘ non istic obliquo oculo mea com—
moda quisquam limat.' Gellius cites from Pliny a statement ‘ oeulis
exitialem fascinationem fieri . . . esse homines in myriis, qui interi-
mant videndo, quos diutius irati viderint)

104. Apollo was the god of soothsaying, under his title of Loxias.
Cp. Eur. Ion 243, 974, etc., [ph. T. 1280, 1438.

105. Servius mentions a tradition that Virgil himself interpreted
this riddle of one Caelius of Mantua, who had squandered his estate
and left himself only three ells of land for a tomb. If this be a fact
we must accept the solution for what it is worth; certainly no one
could have guessed it unaided, nor do the words ‘ Caeli spatium’
properly denote the space of ground occupied by the tomb of
Caelius. It may, as Dr. Eryce suggests, have been a current joke at
Mantua about this time.

The ellipse of quam after plus, amplius, etc., is common. Cp.
G. 4. 207 ‘ plus septima ducitur aestas,⁷ A. 1. 683 ‘noctem non am-
plius unam.' It is either a colloquial abbreviation or possibly a relic
of olden time, when comparison was expressed by simple juxta—
position.

106. inscripti nomina, ‘having the names of princes inscribed
on them’3 a somewhat bold variation of the accus. of respect after
passive verbs in a middle sense, noticed on 1. 54. Instanees like the
present one seem to be developed from the ordinary construction after
verbs of clothing, adoming, etc., as vestem indutus, etc„ of which
Virgil is very fond. Cp. ‘ chlamydem circumdata ’ A. 4. 137,
‘ferrum cingitur' A. 2. 510. An almost parallel instance is tra—
iectus lora, ‘having thongs passed through (his feet)‚' A. 2. 273; cp.
also Hor. Sat. Ι. 6. 74 ‘ suspensi loculos tabulamque lacert0,’ a direct
reproduction of the Greek, as πήραν ἐξηρτημένος in Lucian.
