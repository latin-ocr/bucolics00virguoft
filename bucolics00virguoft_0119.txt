ECLOGUE X. 1—36.

οι· scom (cp. 2. 34); i.e. ‘our sheep scorn not our company3 let us
not seom theirs, since even Adonis fed his flock.' Cp. Theoc. 1. 109
ὡραῖος χῶδωνις, ἐπεὶ καὶ μᾶλα νομεύει. oves represents the lowlier
strain of bucolic verse, which Gallus, though he be a ‘ poet divine‚'
need not despise. Cp. 5. 45, also θεΐε Κομάτα Theoc. 7. 89.

19, 20. upilio, a variant form of opilio (= ovz'pilio). Cp. bubus
and bobus. The ι’ is perhaps long; if so, upilsz is a trisyllable, like
conzIbz‘o A. 1. 73 and elsewhere. [The origin of the -pz'l- is un-
certain: whether from root of πέλ-ω, πόλ-εωεοῖο-πόλος, or from pal-
(pol-) denoting power or protection‚ seen in pollere, etc.]. subulci,

' ‘ swineherds’ (συβώτης). tardi, ‘ plodding.' Imitated from Theoc.

Ι. 80 ἧνθον τοὶ βῶται, τοὶ ποιμένες, ῴπόλοι ἧνθον. uvidus, ‘ wet’
from gathering and steeping acornS, to serve as winter food for
cattle.

21-23. From Theoc. l. c.—⁴

πάντες ἀνηρὼτευν τί πάθοι κακόν· ἧνθ’ ὁ Πρίηπος

κῆφα· Δάφνι τάλαν, τί τὺ τάκεαι;
Virgil substitutes Apollo, as the god of shepherds (5. 15) and of

tion to Eclogue. nives are the Alpine snows (1. 47).

24, 25. The Italian Silvanus is joined with the Arcadian god
Pan. Cp. 5. 35 n. honores=‘omament‚' as ‘ silvis honorem' G.
2. 404, ‘ruris honorum' Hor. Od. Ι. 17. 16. quassans, etc„ per-
haps from Lucr. 4. 487 (of Pan) ‘pinea semiferi capitis velamina
quassans? The garland of fennel and ‘giant lilies’ on his head
nodded as he walked along.

26, 27. quem vidimus ipsi, a special privilege, since the wood-
gods, especially Pan, were accounted dangerous to look upon.
ebuli, ‘dwarf elder.' minio, ‘vermilion.’ Rural deities were
imagined to be of a ruddy countenance‚ and their statues were
painted red.

28-30. modUS, ‘limit ’ to thy laments, since Love cares not for
lovers’ tears. cytiso, see on 1. 78, 2. 64. Columella mentions the
plant as good for bees, as well as for cattle.

31—34. Gallus does not heed his sympathising visitors, but finds his
sole consolation in the thought that Arcadians will make his love
