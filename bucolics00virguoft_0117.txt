main design of the Eclogue. In these specimens Virgil shows not
only his skill as a translator of Theocritus, but also his powers as
an original poet; while by choice of subject (ll. 27, 46) he artfully
directs the attention of his patrons to his own missortunes.

TENTH EGLOGUE.

THIS is a consolatory poem addressed to Cornelius Gallus, whose
mistress Lycoris had deserted him for a rival lover. This Gallus,
whom Virgil had already complimented in the Sixth Eclogue (see
6. 64, etc. n.), is said to have been, like Varus, his fellow-student
under Siron, and to have interested himself in behalf of the Mantuan
farmers whose lands were confiscated by the triumvirs. Being him-
self a poet (l. 50 n.) and a patron of poets, he is here represented,
under the usual bucolic allegory, as one of the pastoral company.
Hence arises the confusion, previously noticed in the introduction to
the First Eclogue, between the real Gallus, a soldier of the camp in
Italy, and the ideal Gallus, in the guise of a shepherd in Arcadia,
with swains and wood-gods as companions in his sorrow. But the
poetic beauties of the Eclogue‚ far surpassing the occasion which
called it forth, its dignity and graceful loveliness, more than com·
pensate for any incongruities of form. It is, as Prof. Sellar observeS,
‘the idealised expression of unfortunate love,' a subject that seems to
have had a peculiar attraction for virgil, and one in the description
of which he always excels. (See Ecl. 2 ; 8. 17-61 ; Aen. 4.)

The Lycoris of the poem is said to have been an actress known as
Cytheris, whose real name was Volumnia. From the allusions in
11. 23, 46 it is supposed that she deserted Gallus for some officer in
the army of M. Agrippa, who led an expedition into Gaul across the
Rhine in 38 or 37 B. c. The Eclogue may have been written in the
latter year (or even in 36), when the other nine were ready for
