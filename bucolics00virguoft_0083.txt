ECLOGUE III. 109—JV.

the honour of being the hero of this poem. But the language of

’ l. 17 (see note) has been thought inapplicable to the consular dignity

of Pollio, while that of 1. 49 cannot be satisfactorily explained, save
by reference to the great Julian family, which claimed deszent from
the gods—‘ Augustus Caesar, divi genus' A. 6. 792. Also, if virgil
had intended a son of Pollio, he would not barely have stated the
fact of his birth during Pollio's consulship (l. ΙΙ). Hence many
commentators have thought that the poet referred to an expected
child of Octavianus by Scribonia, whom he had recently married.
This child however turned out to be a daughter, Julia, afterwards
notorious: and even if we suppose that virgil may have hazarded a
guess at the sex of the child before its birth, it seems unlikely that he
would have let the Eclogue stand, after the event had falsified his
predictions. A close examination of the poem discovers a vague-
ness of language, which was probably intentional. Avoiding any
distinct declaration. of parentage Virgil speaks of a child, whom
either Pollio οι· Octavian &had a son been born to him) might have ,
claimed as his own.

The current belief of the early Christians‚ that this child was the
promised Messiah, claimed sor its support certain forged Sibylline
verses of the second century A. D. referring expressly to Christ. This
oracle is quoted as genuine by the Emperor Constantine, and also, in
a Latin version, by Saint Augustum, both of whom believed it to
have been Virgil's original in this Eclogue. Some English divines
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries fell into the same error,
and Pope in the Preface to· his Messialz, ‘ a Sacred Eclogue in imita-
tion of Virgil's Pollio} has assumed it as a fact. There is however
no reason to suppose that virgil had even indirect access to the
Jewish Scriptmes. Traditions of a ‘ Messianic' kind were at this
time widely spread, and possibly some of the current Sibylline pro-
phecies derived ideas from an Oriental source. But the language of
the Eclogue discloses no more than a general, though sometimes
striking resemblance to certain passages in Isaiah‚ which describe a
state of innocence and bliss and an approaching reign of peace
throughout the world. But these images are common to all descrip-
tions of a ‘golden age,' and find abundant parallels in the Greek
and Latin classics (see references and citations in the N otes).

The Fourth Eclogue has little in common with a ‘ pastoral ' poem,
except that the imagery of a golden age (ll. 18- 30, 40 -453 is necessarily
derived from rural objects. The opening lines declare that on this
occasion Virgil meant to transcend the limits of bucolic song. The
scenery is, from the nature of the subject, confined to no particular
locality.
