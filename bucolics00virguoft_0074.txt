NOTES TO THE ECLOGUES.

master (l. 2) or some wealthier lover who would' outbid Corydon 'm
costly gists.

58, 59, proverbial, meaning that he has acted like a madman‚
who should let in the sirocco to his flowers and wild boars to wal—
low in his springs. Austrum, the hot S. W. wind called ·’ plum—
beus' by Hor. Sat. 2. 6. 18, and very injurious to plants.

61, 62. Pallas was the protectress of towns generally (hence her
titles πολιάς, πολιοῦχος, ἐρυσίπτολις), but especially of Athens. ipsa,
in contrast to nobis, ‘ let her keep her towns, give me the country.’
placeant=amem, as in G. 2. 485 ‘ rura mihi . . . placeant.’

63—65. Each creature pursues the object of its desire3 Corydon
pursues tlzee. ipsa, ‘in his turn’(a1’›). For cytisum see 1. Son.
Cp. Theoc. 10. 30 ἁ αἲξ το ν κύτισον, ὁ λύκος τὰν αἶγα διώκει, ἁ
’γέρανος τῶροτρον· ἐγὼ δ’ ἐπὶ τὶν μεμάνημαι.

65. For a long vowel unelided in the theszs cp. 3. 79; 6. 44;
8. 108.

66. iugo would seem naturally to go with suspensa, ‘ hung’ or
⁴ tilted upon·the yoke,' with the share turned upwards, so as not to
touch the ground. Cp. Hor. Epod. 2. 63 ‘ vomerem inversum boves
collo trahentes languido.’ But Forbiger, Conington, and others
take iugo with referunt, ‘are drawing home hythe yoke.’ sus—
pensa, ‘upraised‚' as in phrases like suspenso pedez‘on tiptoe.'
It is not easy to decide.

The general idea is—‘everything is at rest and calm3 1 only arn
restless from love.' Cp. Theoc. 2. 58, and Pope’s imitation at the
end of his second Pastoral‚ ‘ on me love’s fiercer flames for ever
prey.' ⁸

67. For the lengthening shadows see on 1. 83.

69. From Theoc. 1 Ι. '72 ὦ Κύκλωψ, Κύκλωψ, πᾶ τὰς φρένας ἐκπεπό-
τασαι;

70. semiputata does not occur elsewhere. Corydon in his dis-
traction neglects his duties‚ leaving a vine half pruned and an elm
tree untrimmed of its leaves. See note on ‘ frondator’ 1. 56.

71, 72. quin . . . paras, etc„ ‘why not set about making some
one at least (of the implements) which daily need requires?' quin
:qut non, ‘how not?' i.e. ‘why not?' With aliquid se. eorum.
aliquid saltem=‘something however little,' light work, such as
basket-making. molli, ‘ pliant.’ detexere, ‘ plait out,' i. e. ‘ finish ⁹

The three concluding lines are a continuation from Theoc. 11. 72
referred to above (l. 69)-
