NOTES TO THE ECLOGUES.

ductum, ‘thin’ or ‘ slender’; i.e. light themes of song. Cp. Hor.
Ep. 2. 1. 225 ‘ tenui deducta poemata filo? The shepherd is bidden
to ‘ keep his sheep fat and his verses lean.'

6, 7. super tibi erunt, ‘ you will have poets in plenty ' (‘ enough
and to spare'). For the tmesis of preposition and verb cp. ‘ super
unus eram ' A. 2. 567. For Varus see introduction to this Eclogue.
condere = ‘treat of) lit. ‘put together.' ⁴ Caesaris acta condere '
Ov. T rz‘st. 2. 336. Probably the civil wars, especially Varus' ex·
ploits in Cisalpine Gaul, are referred to ; but we know very little of
his life.

8, nearly a repetition of 1. 2, where see note on meditaris.

9. non iniussa, ‘not without warrant‘ (C), i.e. from Apollo
(11- 3, 4)-

10-12. The sense is, ‘ Though I cannot comply with your request‚
yet your name shall be read in this pastoral song of mine by all the
world.’ myricae =‘ humbler strains.’ Cp. 4. 2 n. pagina = carmen,
as in Mart. 1. 5. 8 ‘lasciva est nobis pagina.' But the use of the
word here, as implying a written and published poem, is alien to the
assumed bucolic character. See note on lectori 3. 85.

13-15. Chromis et Mnasylus, probably shepherds, though some
take them to be Fauns, since the wood-gods were believed to be
dangerous to mortals. But see note on timidis l. 20. Iaccho z
vino. Ἴακχος (ἰαχεῖν) was the mystic name of Bacchus. Cp. 7. 61.

16. procul, either with tantum, ‘just a little way off ' (supposed
to be a reproduction of τυτθὸν ὅσσον ἄπωθεν Theoc. 1. 45) 3 or, taking
tantum with delapsa, ‘ at a short distance, just fallen off his head.'
procul <like πόρρω, πρόσω) means ‘at some distance‚’ not necessarily
⁸ far off.’ Cp. A. 10. 835, where the sense requires ‘nean' capiti,
dat. for the more usual a capite. Cp. Ov. Met. 6. 592 ‘lateri vellera
dependent,’ and probably A. 5. 722 ‘caelo facies delapsa.' It is an
extension of the construction of the dat. incommodi after verbs like
detrahere, etc. to other verbs denoting separation. Cp. 4. 41 n.

17. attrita, ‘worn' by constant use. cantharus, prob. from
κάνθαρος, a beetle·shaped ‘tankard.⁷ pendebat, sc. manu, i.e. the
sleeping Silenus still clutches it.

19. For order of words C. compares Lucr. 3. 10 ‘ tuis ex, incluta,
chartis.' Cp. also 8. 59. The binding of Silenus may have been
suggested by that of Proteus in Homer, Od. 4. 400, etc. But a
similar story is told of Silenus himself in Ov. llffet. 11. 90, how he
was bound by some Phrygian shepherds and taken before king
Midas·

20, 21. timidis, according to Dr. Kennedy, ·’ startled ' at Aegle's
sudden appearance. But it seems more natural to render it ‘ alarmed ’
