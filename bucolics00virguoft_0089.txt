ECLOGUE JV. 58—V. 12.

l. 56 ; lastly, the association of his worship as a divus with that of
Apollo (l. 66), when his birthday was ordered to be kept as a
festival, continuously with that of the Ludi Apollinares, on July 12
and the following days. In all this there is of course no direct or
positive evidence that Virgil intended anything more than a song on
the death and glorification of Daphnis, suggested (as we have seen)
by Theocritus; but the reference to Caesar is, regarding all the cir-
cumstances of the time, highly probable and deserves at least serious
consideration.

The scenery, as elsewhere, is Sicilian rather than Italian, and
apparently borrowed from Theocritus.

Lines 1, 2. boni inflare, for acl instandum, a Greek construction
very common in poetry. Cp. ‘ cantare periti' 10. 32. So, especially
in Horace, the adjectives aptus, idoneus, callidus, prudens, cautus,
etc. are followed by the infin. as a verbal noun. cur non, like τί οὔ
=‘let us‚’ etc. Cp. ‘quin paras’ 2. 71, 72 n.

3, 4. considimus, ‘seat ourselves.’ The other reading conse-
dimus is like the Greek aon'st with present force. Conington com—
pares Aesch. From. 766 τί . . . οὐκ ἔρριψ’ ἐμαυτήν, etc. maior,
‘ elder.’ Cp. ‘ maximus Ilioneus' A. 1. 521.

Δ5, 6. sub umbras, after succedimus. The construction then
changes to the more usual dative antro as in l. 19. incertas,
‘ chequered,' as the wind blows the leaves to and fro.

7. raris, ‘ straggling‚’ not compact. See on ‘rara umbra' 7. 46.
labrusca, the ‘wild vine? Cp. Hom. Od. 5. 69 ἡμερὶς ἡβώωσα τε-
θήλει δὲ σταφυλῇσιν (racemis) which covered the cave of Calypso.
sparsit, ‘ has o’erspread.’ For indic. after aspice ut cp. 4. 52 n.

8. certat not certet, which would imply some real pretensions
on the part of Amyntas. For dat. tibi, instead of tecum, cp. 8. 55,
also A. 4. 38 ‘pugnabis amori! Amyntas is a common pastoral
name, but it may have been chosen in reference to the jealous
Amyntas of 2. 38.

9. quid si, etc. =‘ he might as well try,' etc„ implying an impos·
sibility. Wagner cites Ter. Heaut. 4. 3 ‘ quid si caelum ruat?’

10, 11. Phyllidis ignes, ‘love-songs to Phyllis? These names
are probably fictitious, though Ovid, Asel. 1 3. 68 3, mentions a sculptor
Alcon, and some say that Codrus was a poet hostile to Virgil. If
he is the one mentioned in 7. 22, 29 as the poet of ‘evil tongue,’
iurgia Codri may mean ‘ reproaches uttered by Cod1us‚’ ς’( C.'s rail- '
ing rimes'); but most editors render it ‘ invectives against Codrus.’

12. From Theoc. 3. 1, 2 ταὶ δέ μοι αἶγες Ι βόσκονται κατ’ ὅρος καὶ
ὃ Τίτυρος αὐτὰς ἐλαύνει.
