APPENDIX C.

Seen through the torrent's sweep,
As he followed the light
Of the fleet nymph's flight
To the brink of the Dorian deep.

‘Oh save me! oh guide me!
And bid the deep hide me.
For he grasps me now by the hair!‘
The loud Ocean heard,
To its blue depth stirred‚
And divided at her prayer3
And under the water
The Earth's white daughter
F led like a sunny beam;
Behind her deseended
Her billows unblended
With the brackish Dorian stream¹z
Like a gloomy stain
On the emerald main
Alpheus rushed behind,—
As an eagle pursuing
A dove to its ruin
Down the streams of the cloudy wind.

Under the bowers
Nl'here the Oeean powers

Sit on their pearled thrones,
Through the coral woods
Of the weltering floods,

Over heaps of unvalued stones:
Through the dim beams
Which amid the streams

VVeave a network of coloured light;
And under the caves,

VVhere the shadowy waves

Are as green as the forest's night:
Outspeeding the shark
And the swordfish dark,

1 Virg, E. x, 5.
