SECOND ECLOGUE.

THIS is perhaps the earliest in order of the Bucolics, written prob-
ably in 43 01· 42 B.C., before the fifth and apparently before the third
Eclogue‚ as we gather from 5. 86, 87. It is for the most part closely

imitated from the second Idyll of Theocritus, whence Virgil *has
¹ borrowed much of the passionate language addressed by Polyphemus
to the nymph Galatea; inappropriate‚ to say the least, in the case of
Corydon and his Alexis. But for graces of style and descriptive
elegance this Eclogue stands inferior to none, and is perhaps hardly
equalled by any of— the rest.

Corydon declares his ardent but unrequited affection sor the young
shepherd Alexis. He deplores his solitary state, and seeks consola-
tion in song.
