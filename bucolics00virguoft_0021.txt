WORKS CONSULTED. 17

After the fifth century collections of the classics began to
be made in monastic libraries, and from the ninth century
onwards ‘cursive⁷ MSS. were largely multiplied. The Renais-
sance period of the fifteenth century was fruitful in collec-
tions and copies of MSS„ and after the invention of printing
in 1450 their number rapidly increased. The editio princeps
of Virgil was published at Rome in 1469, successive Venetian
(Aldine) editions followed early in the next century. In the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries commentaries appeared

³ by Heinsius, Burmann (a variorum edition, 1746), and Heyne,

whose fourth edition was revised and augmented by Wagner
in 1830. A smaller one by P. Wagner (1845-1849) served
as a basis for the text of Forbiger (3 vols. 3rd ed. 1852),
specially consulted in the standard English edition by the late
Professor Conington (1858-1871). A reissue of Conington’s
first volume, containing the Bucolics and Georgics, with ad—
ditional notes and essays by Professor N ettleship, appeared
in 1881. Ribbeck's important edition (1859-1862) with its
Prolegomena (1866), giving the result of a laborious colla-
tion of all the principa] MSS„ is, notwithstanding its defects
(criticised by Conington in an appendix to his third volume),
the standard authority for textual criticism at the present
time.

In preparing my own notes ¹, besides the works above
mentioned, I have consulted Ladewig’s fourth edition, with

· German notes, revised by Schaper in 1883, and the well-

known school editions by Dr. Bryce and Dr. Kennedy. The
older commentary by Martyn (1749), and Keightley’s Notes
on the Bucolics (1846), have supplied valuable information,
chiefly on agricultural and botanical matters, Ι have also
been greatly indebted to the Chapters on the Eclogues in

Virgil see Conington's first volume and Mr. Papillon’s Introduction
to his Clarendon Press Edition, 1882.

¹ References in the notes to the commentaries of Conington
Keightleyr and Kennedy are indicated by C., Kt., and K. where the
names are not given in full. The letter P. marks one or two refer-
ences to Mr. Papillon's recent edition (1882).
