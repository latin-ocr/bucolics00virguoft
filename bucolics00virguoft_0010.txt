contemporary records, especially from Memoirs by the poet
Varius (Ecl. ix. 35) and other personal friends of Virgil.
We have besides the internal evidence from Virgil’s own
writings ¹, and from other poets of the time, among whom
Horace was his intimate friend and often mentions him as
a kindred spirit. Lastly there are anecdotes of Virgil and
scattered references in Gellius, Seneca, Macrobius and the
early commentators on his poems.

Ρ. VERGILIUS2 MARO, the son of a small landowner, was
born at Andes near Mantua, Β. C. 70. He went to school,
first at Cremona, then in his 16th year at Mediolanum
(Milan), and was shortly afterwards removed to Rome.
There he studied rhetoric under Epidius with a view to the
Bar, but finding the legal profession uncongenial, he turned
his attention to philosophy under the direction of Siron the
Epicurean. In one of the minor poems ascribed to Virgi13

Ite hinc, Camenae, vos quoque ite iam sane
Dulces Camenae,’ etc.
