ECLOGUE JV. 32—57.

these run on !’ or accusative of the space traversed‚ ‘run through
the ages !’ Cp. ‘currimus aequor' A. 3. 191. Perhaps the former
is to be. preferred, with a comma after saecla, as in the text. The
Fates address their -spindles as the instruments by which the ages

arex rolled on their course, so that‘ said to their spindles' = ‘said, as
they spun 'the thread of time.’ The general sense is ‘may such a
glorious age long continue!‘ coneordeS,‘ agreeing in,' ‘uttering

in concert' (Q). numine, ‘the will,’ or ‘ decrees of Fate.’ Cp.
Hor. Carm. Sacc. 25 ³ Vosque veraces cecinisse, Parcae‚’ etc. The
Parcae were the Μοῖραι. The derivation is uncertain.

48, 49. The child, by anticipation‚ is invited to enter on his new
dignity. honores possibly refers to successive offices of state.
deum suboles, said either generally of a heroic ‘ race divine,' or
:first of a new divine race. If the child is Octavian’s the allusion
will point to the mythical descent of the Julian family (see introduc-
tion to Eclogue). Similarly Iovis incrementum, if not merely:
‘ foster-child ' or ‘ nursling of Jove,' may (as Munro suggests) mean
‘ germ of a future Jove.’ Cp. Ov. Met. 3. 103 where the serpent's
teeth sown by Cadmus are termed ‘ populi incrementa futuri.’

50, 51. All nature is moved ancl trembles at the advent of the
deity. Cp. Psalm 68. 8 ; 114. 7, also A. 3. 90, etc„ where the temple
and its environs shake at Apollo's coming. mundum probably
means ‘ the world’ (defined in next line by terrasque, etc.) ; then
convexo pondere will be ‘beneatlz the weight of the solid dome (of
the sky).’ Others take mundum=caelum, ‘ bowing witlz its
vaulted mass.’ Cp. ‘ caeli convexa ’ Α. 4. 451 and elsewhere. For
que long in arsi before tr cp. G. 1. 153 ‘lappaeque tribulique';
also before l A. 3. 91, and before s A. 12. 363. The present line is
repeated in G. 4. 222. profundum, imitated literally by Gray in his
‘ azure deep of air.’ But profundum here=‘ lofty‚' just as altus is
both ‘deep ’ and ‘ high!

52. The subj. laetentur (which some read) is not needed. Phrases
like aspice-ut, viden-ut, eto, became mere interjections, not affecting
the mood. So ‘nescio quis fascinat' 3. 103.

53-59. The sense is, ‘ May Ι only live to sing his praises: no
poet, human or divine, should excel me.’

53, 54. tam longae=tamdz'u; ‘ may my life's latest years be
prolonged‚' etc. spiritus=poetic inspiration. dicere, a free poet-
ical infin, where prose would require ad dicendum.

56, 57. For the various traditions about Linus, the fabled son of
Apollo by one of the Muses, see Classical Dictionaiy. Here Or-
pheus and Linus represent mythical masters of song. Orphei is the
Greek dative, Ὀρφεῖ.
