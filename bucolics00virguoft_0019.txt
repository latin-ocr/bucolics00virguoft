MSS. ETC. OF THE BUCOLICS. 15

apotheosis of Daphnis—while the passing allusions in ll. 84,
etc. of the third Eclogue make that poem a fitting precursor

of both. The ninth Eclogue‚ whose subject stands in close
connexion with that of the first, is obviously misplaced. The

rest, of course excepting the tenth, have nothing in thern to
account for their respective order, though possibly, as Sellar
thinks, the principle of alternating monologue with dialogue
may have determined their arrangement. The titles (Tityrus,
Alexis, etc.) commonly prefixed to the several Eclogues may
be a later addition. Lines 86, 87 of Ecl. v seem to imply
that the poems were quoted (like many of our well-known
hymns) by their first lines. The words ‘quae Vari prae-
scripsit pagina nomen' in Ecl. vi. 12, have been thought to
prove that this one at least had Varus forits title; but the
fact of its dedication to him, with Vare twice repeated, may
be a sufficient explanation. It should be observed too that
this particular Eclogue had an alternative title, Silenus.

The rapid success following the publication of the Bucolics
is attested by our old authority 1, Suetonius. From this time
forward the fame of Virgil as a popular poet was established.
Tacitus, de Oratoribus Dialogus, c. 13, says that once when
Virgil was present at a recitation of his verses the people
‚rose and did homage to him, but whether the lines recited

were from the Eclogues or the Georgics, or from the com-
pleted portions of the Aeneid, does not distinctly appear.

MSS. AND PRINCIPAL EDITIONS.

Of the four great ‘uncial’ MSS. (written in capitals) at
Rome and Florence, dating from the fourth and fifth cen-
turies A.D., only three contain the Bucolz'cs. These are—
(1) the Codex Palatinus (R), now in the Vatican Library,
estimated as the best authority3 (2) the Medicean (M.), in
the Laurentian Library at Florence; (3) the Roman (R),
also in the Vatican, but of inferior authority to the others.
