NOTES TO THE ECLOGUES.

13, 14. immo, ‘nay rather,’ Greek μὲν οὖν (Κ.). cortice, i. e.
of the living tree, as viridi implies. Cp. 10. 53. The smooth
beech trunk would suit the purpose well. modulans = ‘ as Ι played
the tune.’ alterna is difficult. It may go (Ι) with notavi=‘the
alternation of flute and voice’ (Q), or ‘ 1 marked the notes at
intervals' on the words (K.); (2) with modulans, ‘ sang line by
line and marked them down ’ (R). Perhaps the first is best. At all
events alterna cannot here mean ‘amoebaean ’ strains, as the song of
Mopsus is continuous.

15. deinde, ‘ after tlzat‚' i. e. when you have heard me sing. So
εἶτα, ἔπειτα in Greek. Mopsus is nettled at the mention of Amyntas;
hence Menalcas proceeds to reassure him.

16, 17. pallenti, ‘pale green.' Cp. 2. 47; 3. 9n. The willow
resembles'the olive in shape and colour of the leaves, but is less
valuable. The saliunca, ‘Celtic reed‚' had a sweet smell like the
rose, but was too brittle and short-stemmed to be woven into gar·
lands (Ka). Cp. Plin. N. H. 21. 7 ‘saliunca . . . brevis, et quae
necti non possit.’ The point of the comparison is that any re-
semblance between Amyntas and Mopsus is merely superficial.

19. desine plura: ‘say no more' ; but there is a verbal confusion
between desine loqui and parce plura dicere (C.) For acc. after
desine cp. 8. 61.

20. Daphnis was fabled to be the son of Hermes by a nymph.
Theoc. Ι. 141 calls him τὸν Μώσαις φίλον ἄνδρα, τὸν οὐ Νύμφαισιν
ἀπεχθῆ. He is said to have died rather than confess himself worsted
by Aphrodite, having once boasted that he would never yield to the
power of love. For the supposed allegorical allusion in the death of
Daphnis to that of Julius Caesar see introduction to this Eclogue.

21. Note the heavy melancholy effect of the initial spondee, fle-
bant, followed by a pause3 also of the successive spondees in l. 24.
Cp. A. 6. 213.

23. This use of atque . . . atque=‘b0th . . . and,' is confessedly
rare. The instance quoted from Silius Italicus, 1. 90, is probably
imitated from the present line. In Tibull. 2. 5. 73 the construction
is doubtful ; in Catull. 68. 152 ‘ haec atque illa dics, atque alia atque
alia‚’ each atque means ‘and,' W'agner and others adopt the
awkward alternative of taking complexa (est) as a finite verb
coupled by atque to vocat. astra, in reference to the supposed
influence of the stars on human affairs. crudelia with vocat, ‘ eries
out upon the cruelty,‘ etc.

27, 28. Cp. Theoc. 1. 71, where the herds and wild beasts mourn
1'or Daphnis, τῆνον μὰν θῶες, τῆνον λύκοι ὠδύραντο, etc. Poenus, a
literary or ornamental epithet3 see note on 1. 55. The mention of
