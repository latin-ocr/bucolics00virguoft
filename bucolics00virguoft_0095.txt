ECLOGUE V. 76—VJ. 5.

the Epicurean system of cosmogony; next of Deucalion’s deluge
and the reign of Saturnus, and finishes by relating some of the most
famous stories of ancient mythology.

The Varus, to whom the Eclogue is dedicated, is almost certainly
Alfenus Varus, the successor of Pollio in Cisalpine Gaul, to whom
Virgil appeals in the Ninth Eclogue ¹pl. 27) with the promise of a
poem in his honour. He had probably asked Virgil to celebrate his
exploits in the wars, but the poet feigns an excuse (11. 3-5), and
begs Varus to accept the dedication of a pastoral poem instead.
His choice of a subject was doubtless determined by the influence of
the Epicurean philosophy he had learnt from his instructor Siron,
under whom Varus is said to have studied at the same time; partly
also by the example of Lucretius, then lately deceased, whose philo-
sophica] system was much in vogue at this time, and must have had
a peculiar attraction for Virgil. Taking advantage of an old legend
respecting Silenus in Phrygia Nsee note on l. 19), he introduces him
as the narrator. The mythological portion of the Eclogue seems to
be derived mainly from the Ἑτεροιούμενα of Nicander, to which
Ovid was afterwards indebted for his Metamorphoses. The episode
of Gallus (see 1. 64 n.) is certainly irrelevant, but was introduced in
compliment to the friend and patron to whose praises V1rgil sub-
sequently devoted an entire Eclogue., the Tenth and last.

The date is probably 40 or 39 Β. (3., but there is no internal
evidence to decide it.

Lines 1, 2. prima=primum, ‘at first,' in reference to Virgil’s
earliest efforts in verse. Syracosio = ‘ pastoral'3 cp. 4. 1 n. The Greek
form Συρᾶκόσιος is used for the metre's sake. For ludere see 1. 103
for silvas cp. ‘ silvestrem Musam’ 1. 2 ; also 4. 3 ; 5. 43 n, Thalia
may represent ‘Muse' generally, like Melpomene in Hor. 4. 3. 1,
and elsewhere. But Thalia seems to have been regarded not only
as the Museof comedy, but of pastoral poetry also.

3. Cp. Hor. Od. 4. 15. 1 ‘ Phoebus volentem proelia me loqui . . .
increpuit lyra.' reges et proelia denotes heroic poetry. Suetonius
says of Virgil, ⁶ Cum res Romanas incohasset. qffimsus materia, ad
Bucolica transiit'; that is, he found these loftier subjects too hard
for him, and Phoebus is said to have given him a friendly reminder
of the fact, · the ear (as C. observes) being considered as the seat of
memory. See Introd. p. 7. Milton imitates this passage in Lycidas
77‘ Phoebus replied, and touched my trembling ears?

4, 5. Tityre, probably any shepherd3 though some think Virgil
means to identify himself with the Tityrus of the F1rst Eclogue.
