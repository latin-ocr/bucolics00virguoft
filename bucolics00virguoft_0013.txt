PASTORAL POETR Y. 9

The eighth is prefaced by an address to Pollio ¹, who is also
mentioned in the third Eclogue as the poet’s patron, while the
ninth‚ as we have said, contains a direct appeal to Varus.
This EcIogue, together with the first, is almost wholly
occupied with Virgil’s private affairs; the fifth almost cer—
tainly describes the deification of Julius Caesar under the guise
of pastoral allegory. Only the second and seventh Eclogues
remain as pure pastorals‚ without any contemporary al-
lusions²; the prevalence of such allusions elsewhere marks,
as will presently appear, the beginning of a new phase in
the history of bucolic poetry ³.

Whatever may be the result of speculations as to the
remoter origins of the Pastoral ⁴, the Sicilian Theocritus was
certainly the first who developed it as a distinct species of
literature. Born at Syracuse, educated probably under
Philetas in the isle of Cos, he took with him recollections of
his native Sicilybto the court of Ptolemy at Alexandria,

, where an artificial and refined mode of living made the

representation of rural scenes charming by way of contrast.
His Idyllz'a, or ‘little pictures‚' are for the most part drawn
from nature3 presenting in a partly dramatic, partly nar-
rative form the manners of Sicilian swains, singing of their
flocks and herds, their rustic loves, the joys and occasional
sorrows of simple country life. Much indeed of the colour-
ing and ornament in these Idylls is due to the artistic
requirements os a literary age, but the foundation is real,

¹ See Introduction to the eighth Eclogue.

² Unless the Codrus mentioned in E. 7. 22 represents a poet of the
day, but this is doubtful.

³ For a fuller account of the rise and progress of pastoral poetry
see Introduction to my edition of Milton’s Lycidas (Longmans, 1874).

⁴ Ancient traditions differ as to the precise date, but agree in
referring the origin of pastoral poetry to rustic festivals of Artemis
in Greece or Sicily, which gave rise to a regular custom of singing
for prizes of loaves and skins full of wine in rude bucolic fashion.
In course of time these contests of song would attract the notice of
professional poets‚ and cause them to adopt a similar mode of

expression. Thus a distinct school of bucolic poetry arose in Sicily.
