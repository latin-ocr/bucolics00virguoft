ECLOGUE ll. 58-JH· 11.

'I'HIRD EOLO GUE.

THIS Eelogue, like the preceding, is closely imitated from Theo-
. critus, especially from the fifth and eighth Idylls. The opening lines
are an almost literal version of those of the fourth, and isolated
passages from the first and other Idylls have also been adapted. Its
date may be as early as B.C. 43 (see introduction to Ecl. 2).

Two herdsmen sing against each other for a prize with Palaemon
as umpire. The singing is of the kind called ‘amoebaean’ (δι’
ἀμοιβαίων Theoc. 8. 01), in which the competitors sing alternately
(ἀμειβόμενοι). One having taken the lead, the other must reply
impromptu on the same or a similar subject in an equal number of
verses, and this continues until one of the two gives in or the umpire
puts an end to the contest. In the present instance the match is
declared drawn.

dThe scenery is of a mixed kind, and probably sor the most part
i eal.

Lines 1, 2. From Theoc. 4. 1, 2 (Battus and Corydon) B. εἰπέ μοι,
ὦ Κορύδων, τίνες αἱ βόες; ἧ ρα Φιλώνδας C. oiitc', ἀλλ’ Αἴγωνος·
’βόσκεν δέ μοι αὐτὰς ἔδωκεν. cuium, an obsolete possessive, common
ianerence and Plautus. Its survival in the country dialect justifies
its use here. ,

2. tradidit, ‘gave in charge.' Damoetas is not Aegon's slave,
but a ‘ stranger ’ (l. 5), perhaps a hireling. Menalcas is keeping his
father's sheep (l. 330, who may have been either the owner or himself
a farm slave. At all events the herdsmen treat the flock much as if
it were their own. See on 1. 27.

3. For the order infelix . . . oves pecus, cp. G. 4. 168 ‘ignavum
fucos pecus.’ ipse, ‘the master‚' Aegon; like αὐτός as applied by
pupils to their teacher (αὐτὸς ἔφη, ete). This line is from Theoc. 4.

4-6. fovet, ‘ courts,' sc. ‘amplexu' A. 8. 388. alienus. Cp.
l. 2 n. sucus, ‘life-juice' from sug-ere. subducitur. The sub = ‘ by
stealth.’ For the lzz'atus see on 2. 24, and cp. G. 1. 4 ‘pecor ξ ῑ
api Ι bus, 3. 155 ‘pecor Ι i ar Ι mentaque.'

7-9. viris implies that Menalcas had not the courage to defend
himself. qui te, sc. laeserit or some such word=‘assaulted you.'
transversa, adverbial‚ ‘ looking askance' or ‘ with sly glances.‘
Cp. ‘acerba sonans' G. 3. 149, ⁴ sera comantem’ G. 4. 122. faciles,
‘ kind‚' in letting the sacrilege go unpunished.
