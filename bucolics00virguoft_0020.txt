In P. all the lines from Ecl. iii. 71 to iv. 52, in R. from vii. 1 to
x. 9, are wanting, while M. has only vi. 48 to the end of the
Eclogues; so that no one uncial MS. contains the whole.
There are also some fragments in an old MS. known as the
Verona Palimpsest, of about the same date as the above3
this is considered to be of nearly equal authority to the
Palatine Codex. All these are probably, according to Rib-
beck, derived from one original copy, which contained several
readings not found in existing MSS, but known to ancient
commentators, and representing a much older authority than
any we now possess. ‘ Cursive’ MSS. are numerous, dating
mostly from the ninth to the eleventh and twelfth centuries,
Of these the Codex Gudianus at Berne and another of the
Berne Codices are the most important, and closely related
to the uncials P. and R. Three also out of the forty-five Virgil
MSS. in the Bodleian Library at Oxford are held in good
repute, but only two of these contain the Eclogues.

Owing to the rapid popularity of the works of Horace
and Virgil as reading-books in Roman schools ¹, there was
a steady demand for copies (more or less carefully tran-
scribed) as well as for commentaries on the text. The ear-
liest known commentator on Virgil was Q. Caecilius Epirota,
a friend of C. Gallus, who lectured on Virgil soon after the
poet's death, if not before. Among others we may mention

Julius Hyginus, Annaeus Cornutus (the tutor of Persius),
Aemilius Asper, and Valerius Probus, all in the first century

A.D. Much of their materials is preserved by later commen-
tators, such as Donatus and Servius, down to the fourth and
fifth centuries, and is therefore valuable for determining
the text as well as for illustration. Copious quotations from
V irgil occur in the works of writers from the Augustan age
to the fourth century or later, of whom Verrius Flaccus,
Aulus Gellius, Nonius Marcellus, and MacrobiuS, are best
known 2.
