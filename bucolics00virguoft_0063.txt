FIRS'I' EGLOGUE.

THE date os this Eclogue is assigned to the year 40 B.C. After the
battle of Philippi, B.C. 42, large tracts of land throughout Italy were
taken from their owners, and assigned to the veterans in the army
of the victorious triumvirs. Among the rest Virgil was deprived os
his estate near Mantua, notwithstanding his intimacy with Asinius
Pollio, at that time legatus of Cisalpine Gaul. During the year
41 Β. C. Pollio was superseded by Alfenus Varus (see Introduction to
Ecl. 9), and by his influence, in combination with Pollio and Cor-
nelius Gallus, the poet obtained from Octavian an order sor'rein-
statement in his property, and wrote this Eclogue to testify his
gratitude for the favour. ·

The dialogue is between two shepherds, one of whom, Meliboeus,
ejected from his farm and driven into exile, finds Tityrus reposing
under a beech—tree with his flocks around him. He learns how
Tityrus had been to Rome and obtained leave to keep possession
of his property. Congratulating his neighbour upon his good
fortune Meliboeus contrasts his own hard lot, and is moving off,
when Tityrus bids him remain for the night with him at his
cottage.

The poem is partly real, but mainly allegorical. Tityrus of course
represents Virgil himself reinstated in his farm after his successful
visit to Rome; nearly all the rest is fiction. Tityrus is introduced
as a farm-slave or hind (vilicus) going to Rome to buy his
liberty (l. 27), presumably from his master, and whilenthernhegets
an audience from Octavianus and an order for restitution. But the
master is mentioned only by implication, and Tityrus is personally
interested as the owner, or at least joint-owner, of the farm. Hence
the inevitable confusion, noticed by Prof. Conington on p. 11 of
