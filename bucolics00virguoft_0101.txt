SEVEN'PH EGLOGUE.

Tms Eclogue, like the Third, is a singing-match between two
shepherds, Corydon and Thyrsis, but ending in the defeat of the
latter. A goatherd, Meliboeus, who happened to be present, is the
nan-ator. The rules of ‘amoebaean’ singing gsee introduction to
Ecl. 3) are strictly observed‚ only here four lines, instead of two, are
assigned to each competitor.

The poem is entirely pastoral, without any personal or political
allusions. Its opening lines and a few scattered expressions are ³.
imitated from Theocritus, but there is on the whole more originality
in this than in any of the other Eclogues, except perhaps the F ourth
and Sixth.

The date is uncertain, but the poem is probably one of Virgil's
earlier efforts. The locality professes to be Mantuan (1. 13), though
the scenery is, as in most of the Eclogues, confused.

Lines 1, 2. arguta, ‘ whispering' or ‘rustling‚‘ as in 8. 22. The
original meaning (from arguere) is ‘ distinct' or ‘ clear '; hence of
form ‘ clean cut,' as ‘argutum caput ' G. 3. 80 ; of sound, what strikes
the ear clearly and sharply, as ‘arguta fistula’ 1. 24. in unum=
εἰς ἕνα χῶρον Theoc. 6. 1, whence these lines are imitated.

4, 5. Arcades, i. e. skilled in pastoral song, Arcadia being asso-
ciated with Pan, the inventor of the shepherd's pipe (2. 32). Cp.
10. 31—34. The Arcadians of history were noted for boorishness and
