Professor Sellar’s Roman Poets of tlte Augustan Age, and
to Professor Nettleship’s A ncz‘ent Lz'ves of Virgil, containing
a minute survey of the scope and probable dates of the
several Eclogues, and especially valuable on account of the
new light the author has thrown upon the connexion be-
tween the F irst and the Ninth. Ι have appended, for the
purpose of comparison, specimens of the later Bucolic poets
and of Milton’s Epitaphium Damonz's; also a reprint of
Shelley's Arellcusa, in reference to the opening lines of the
tenth Eclogue, and to illustrate the treatment by a modern
poet of an ancient Classical legend.
