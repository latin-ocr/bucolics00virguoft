APPENDIX C.

Under the ocean foam,
And up through the rifts
Of the mountain clists

They passed to their Dorian home.

And now from their fountains
In Enna's mountains

Down one vale where the morning basks
Like friends once parted
Grown single-hearted,

They ply their watery tasks.
At sunrise they leap
From their eradles steep

In the cave of the shelving hi113
At noontide they flow
Through the woods below

And the meadows of AsphodelÍ¾
And at night they sleep
In the rocking deep

Beneath the Ortygian shore3
Like spirits that lie
In the azure sky,

When they love but live no more.
