ECLOGUE VII. 37—70.

57, 58. vitio, ‘taint.' Cp. ‘morbo caeli’ G. 3. 478, ‘corrupto
caeli tractu’ A. 3. 138, also ‘morbidus aer' Lucr. 6. 1097. Liber,
ete„ i.e. the vines are withering on the hill-slopes; hence Bacchus
is said to ‘ grudge ‘ the hills their wonted shade. For this construc-
tion of invidere cp. G. 1. 503 ‘ nobis caeli te regia, Caesar, invidet‚'
also A. 4. 234. In prose it usually takes the dative simply. [Liber
is probably from the same root as lib-are, λείβειν, not connected
with liber, ‘ free.’]

60. Iuppiter, i. e. the sky, as in G. 1. 418, Hor. Od. 1. 1. 25, and
elsewhere. In G. 2. 325 he is identified with Aether, and is said to
descend into the bosom of his sponse, the Earth. plurimus, ‘in
abundance.' Cp. ‘ nux plurima' G. 1. 187, ‘ plurimus amnis' A. 6.

61, 62. The poplar was sacred to Hercules, who is said to have
made a garland from it as he returned from his expedition to Hades.
Cp. G. 2. 66 ⁵ Herculeaeque arbos umbrosa coronae? In Theoc. 2.
121 the λευκά, ‘white poplar‚’ is called Ἡρακλέος ἱερὸν ἔρνος. For
Iaccho see note on 6. 15.

The myrtle grows on the sea-shore, and Venus (Aphrodite) is said
to have covered herself with its boughs, when she rose from the sea-
foam. For the laurel as connected with Phoebus see the story of
Daphne in Ovid, Met. 1. 452—567.

66-68. in fluviis, i. e. on river banks‚ ‘ fluviali consita ripa’ Ov.
Her. 5. 2 5. The comparison of Lycidas himself to a tree is somewhat
forced, but a comparison of savourite trees would have been a mere

repetition of Corydon’s subject. Thyrsis therefore has to make the
best of the situation.

70. From TheOC. 8. 92 κήκ τούτω Δάφνις παρὰ ποιμέσι πρᾶτος
ἔγεντο. The best interpretation seems to be ‘ hencesorth Corydon is
our Corydon,’ i.e. the Corydon par excellence; his very name is a
title of honour.

EIGH'I'H ECLOGUE.

THIS Eclogue relates the songs of two contending swains, the
former of whom, Damon, speaks in the character of a shepherd
reproaching his false mistress Nysa, who has deserted him for
Mopsus, and vowing to kill himself. Alphesiboeus follows with the
description of a woman who is trying to win back her estranged
lover by magic arts. This latter song is imitated from the Second
Idyll of Theocritus, known by the title of Pharmaceutrz'a.

The main portion of the Eclogue (from l. 17) consists of two con-
