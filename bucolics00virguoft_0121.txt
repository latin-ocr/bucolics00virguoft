And with ye let my love do so.’
55-59. mixtis Nymphis, ‘ with nymphs in company.’ Cp.

(for mixtum, mixta). lustrabo, ‘ 1 will range,’ either in the dance

“ (1111511310 011010 ’ A. 7. 391) or in the chase ; but aut seems to mark

a distinction. Maenala (cp. 8. 21) and Parthenios refer to Arcadia3
but Partho and Cydonia [in Crete) are literary epithets (like
Iafitblaez‘s in 1. 54), the Parthians and Cretans being famed for archery.

‘farewell ’; imitated by Milton, Epz't. Damonis 160 ‘cedite silvae.’

65, 66. Partly from Theoc. 7. 111, though in a different connex-

is a general epithet of winter, not strictly suited to the frozen regions
of Thrace.

69. amor et, also in A. 11. 323 and elsewhere. Cp. Α. 2. 369
‘ pav6r et.' That the 0 is naturally long is shown by the long vowel
in the Greek -ωρ and the oblique cases of Latin nouns in -0r; but
