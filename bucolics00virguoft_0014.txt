and the songs and dialogues‚ in which rustiC, sOmetimes
coarse banter alternates with the utmost delicacy and re-
finement, are such as Theocritus must often have heard
in his native land. How much in the Idylls is to be taken
as literal fact we cannot now determine, but before very
long pastoral poetry began to lose something of its primi-
tive simplicity. The real and the dramatic characters
became confused, the shepherd was identified with the poet, ’
and pastoral names like Lycidas, Menalcas and the rest
were understood to represent by a sort of allegory the
author himself and his friends, or his rivals Theocritus
indeed is nearly free from this confusion 3 only in his seventh
Idyll does he mention his instructors, Asclepiades and
Philetas, by name, to whom, in the character of Simichidas,
he professes himself inferior. But in the third Idyll of
Moschus the poet's personality is but thinly disguised3 for
in his lament over his deceased master Bion he compares
him in express terms with Homer, Hesiod, and Pindar, and
even with Theocritus himself, representing him at the same
time as a shepherd xpiping to his flocks and milking his
goats in the plains and pastures of Sicily. Passing through
the two intervening centuries, during which the history of
pastoral poetry is almost a blank, to the Eclogues of Virgil,
we find the transition complete. The ‘ pastoral' has now
become little more than a particular mode of expression,
a form in which the poem, whatever its subject, is conven-
tionally cast, while the terms ‘Siciliam’ ‘Syracusan‚' or
‘Arcadian’ are recognised as distinctive literary epithets
of bucolic song 1. The confusion is increased by the ap-
plication of Greek pastoral to the circumstances of Italian life
and the transference of Sicilian scenery to the environs
of Mantua. The names of Virgil’s shepherds are Greek,
and the incidents of their lives, their sentiments, nay their
very words, are minutely reproduced from those of the
Theocritean swains 3 nevertheless they talk with one
