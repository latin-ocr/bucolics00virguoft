NOTES TO THE ECLOGUES.

67. For Linus cp. 456 n. divino carmine, abl. of quality=
‘shepherd poet divine‚' cp. 5. 45 The legendary Linus was not a
shepherd, but Virgil here assigns him a bucolic title. So inl. 69,
Linus gives Gallus a shepherd’s pipe, once a present from the Muses
to Hesiod; but Hesiod himself < leeog: 30) says it was a branch of
bay (δάφνης ἐριθηλέος ὄζον), which enabled him to ‘sing of things
past and things to come.'

68-70. apio, as a festive garland. Cp. Hor. Od. 1. 36. 16; 2. 7.
24; 4. 11. 3 ‘nectendis apium coronis.’ calamos. Cp. 2. 32 n.
Ascraeo seni, ‘ the ancient bard of Ascra ' in Boeotia. Hesiod is
here credited with the powers of Orpheus to move trees by his song.

71—73. his, sc. calamis} Cp. 5. 87 n. Grynei nemoris. Gallus
had translated a poem by Euphorion of Chalcis concerning the ⁶ grove
of Grynium ⁹ in Mysia, where were a temple and oracle of Apollo.
Hence ‘ Gryneus Apollo ’ A. 4. 345. Cp. 10. 50 n. Virgil bids Gallus
tell the story in strains of which Apollo himself may be proud.

74. aut Scyllam, sc. ut narraverit, from l. 78. The infinitives
vexasse, lacerasse, depend on fama secuta est=quaesertur, ‘to
whom the story clings that she,' etc. (Q). Virgil confounds Scylla
the daughter of Nisus with the more famous Scylla described in
A. 3. 424, etc, from Homer, Od. 12. 85—100. Ovid and Proper-
tius have made the same mistake.

75, 76. Cp. Lucr. 5. 892 ‘ rabidis canibus succinctas semimarinis
Corporibus Scyllas.’ Homer does not mention this. Dulichias,
i. e. of Ulysses the Ithacan. Dulichium was really one of the
Echinades islands, near Ithaca, which were not, according to
Homer, under the dominion of Odysseus. Ovid‚ Met. 14. 226, calls
Ulysses ‘ Dulichium ducem.’

78—81. mutatos, etc., i.e. the transformation of Tereus into a
hawk or hoopoe. According to the Greek legend, Philomela was
the sister and Procne the wife of Tereus, who served up her son
Itys at his table, and was changed into a nightingale, Philomela into
a swallow, The Roman version made Philomela the nightingale.
dapes is the flesh of Itys, dona his head, which was presented to
Tereus aster his meal. The nom. to petiverit may be Tereus or
Philomela, probably the latter, to avoid change of subject. For
quibus alis, etc.‚ see Ι. 43 n. ; though quo cursu may mean ‘ with
what (unwonted) speed,’ i. e. on wings. ante, ‘ before ’ she (or he)

flew off to the woods. It is awkward to take it (as some do) with ,

sua=‘ once her own.’ sua by itself would mean this, like ‘ mea
regna' 1. 69. supervolitaverit, as C. observes, seems to point to
the habits of the swallow, but Vir-gil most likely followed the
Roman version of the story (see above).
