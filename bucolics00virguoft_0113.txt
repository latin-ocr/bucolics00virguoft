ECLOGUE [Χ. 1-7·

as we are assured on good authority that neither hills nor beeches
are found in the district about Mantua, we must suppose the scene
to be as imaginary as in most of the other Eclogues, though in one
passage (1. 57, where see note) it is apparently Sicilian. See
Keightley's Notes on Bucolz'cs, pp. 15, 16, also p. 129.

[Note.—Though strongly inclined to accept Professor N ettleship's
conclusion that Virgil was only once ejected from his farm, I think
he rather overstates the evidence in its favour supplied by the Ninth
Eclogue itself. Commentiug on the words in l. 3 quod numquam
veriti sumus he asks ‘ How could it [an ejectment] appear impos-
sible, isit had happened . . . only a few months before?' But surely
the distinct promise of Octavian, obtained through the influence of
powerful patrous, might well have justified a feeling of security in
the future, whatever might have happened previously. The absence
of any distinct allusion to the fact ot Octavian's interference‚ had he
actually interfered in Virgil's behalf, does at first sight seem strange;
but would it not have been, to say the least, highly impolitic on the
poet's part to remind so exalted a personage that his order had been
practically disregarded? It seems to me that the expression in 1. 48
quo segetes gauderent, etc., ‘under which the fields ought to be re-

ᾊι. joicing (but in fact are not),' about reaches the limits of what could,

under the supposed circumstances, have been said with safety. These

passages in fact prove nothing either way as regards the point in

dispute; but since there is not a word in this Eclogue that compels

’ ns to adopt the hypothesis of a double ejection, and there is no good
historical evideuc: in its favour, it may very well be abandoned.

Nothing in any case can be established by a reference to the First
Eclogue, that being a bona fide expression of belief in a state 01
security, the permanence of which time alone could decide. We
should be unwilling however to think that the grateful protestations
of Tityrus were after all uttered in vain; and it is hardly conceivable
that virgil would have allowed the poem to stand, especially in so
prominent a place, had his appeal therein recorded been even so
far without effect.]

Line 1. quo te pedes, ⁶ whither away ?' sc. ducunt.

2-4. vivi pervenimus, sc. eo=⁴ we have lived to see,’ etc.
The disjointed order of words expresses Moeris' perturbations.
haec mea sunt was the legal formula in claiming possession. For
the facts see introduction to Eclogue.

6. nee for ne, as in 10. 46, a temnant of ancient usage, in legal
forms, prayerS, etc. It is found in Plautus, also in Liv. 5. 53 ‘ nec
mirati sitis.' quod nec vertat bene: ‘ bad luck go with them Ξ ’

7-10. se subducere, lit. ‘withdraw themselves,’ i. e. ‘diminish'
or ‘sink down.’ [C. renders it ‘to rise,' as regarded from below,
demittere being regarded from above, but this is a rarer meaning
