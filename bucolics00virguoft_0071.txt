ECLOGUE J. 76—JJ. 21.

Line 1. ardebat, transitive. as in Hor. od. 4. 9. 13 · comptos arsit
adulteri crines.'

2. delicias, ‘favouritef domini, probably Iollas. See l. 57n.
quid speraret, etc.‚ ‘knew not what to hope’ (oblique question
disguised). ‘ Quod speraret ' would mean ‘ he had nothing to hope
for' (dependent relative clause).

3. tantum, ‘as his only solace’ (C.). cacumina, in apposi-
tion with fagos, not acc. of respect after umbrosa. Cp. 9. 9.

4. incondita, ‘unstudied‚' ‘artless’ Condere carmen (Hor. A.
P. 436) is to ‘ compose a poem’; hence Milton's ‘huild the lofty
rime ’ Lycidas 11.

7. mori, ete, from Theoc. 3. 9 ἀπάγξασθαί με ποιησεΐς,

8. frigora cap-tay. Cp. 1. 53n.

9. From Theoc. 7. 22 ἁνίκα δὴ καὶ σαῦρος ἐφ’ αῖμασισῖσι καθεύδει.
Cp. Tennyson, Oenone, ‘ The lizard rests . . . and the cicala sleeps.’

10. Thestylis. Cp. 1. 43. rapido, ‘scorching‚’ as heat is pro—
duced by swift motion. So ‘ rapidi solis' G. 1. 92.

11. serpyllum, ''wild thyme.' The mixture called moretum
is described in the poem of that name attributed to virgil. It con-
sisted of flour, cheese‚ salt, and oil with various herbs (Kc).

12. mecum, either with resonant =‘as Ι do' (me etiam can-
tante), or, according to V oss=circa me, ‘all round me.' raucis,
³ chirping‚’ in reference to the monotonous note of the cicala (Kc).

14. tristes iras. ‘ sullen rages ’ or ‘ fits of temper.' Cp. 3.
81.

16. esseS‚ for brevity‚ does duty in both clauses; the past tense
properly refers to Menalcas only, ‘quamvis ille niger esset, tu can-
didus sis ’ (C.).

17. colori, ‘complexion,' but implying ‘beauty‚’ fair being pre-
ferred to dark. Cp. 10. 38.

18. ligustra, commonly rendered ‘ privet‚‘ but some more
brilliant white flower is evidently meant, and one at the same time
valueless. Some say ‘ bindweed ’ ; Dr. Kennedy suggests the ⁶ syringa ‘
blossom. vaccinia is perhaps ‘ bilberry ’ ; though Martyn considers
it a form of ὑάκινθος, ‘ hyacinth ' or ‘ larkspur.' Many of these flowers
cannot be precisely identified. cadunt, ‘ fall unheeded.'

19. qui here certainly = qualis (Ι. 19 n.). Cp. τοιοῦτος ἐών
Theoc. 11. 34, whence the next four lines are taken.

21. The epithet Siculis shows how closely Virgil is imitating
his Greek original. See 1. 55 n.; also Introduction, p. 10. meae
also is less appropriate to the slave Corydon than it would be to
the Cyclops, who owned the flocks (see however 1. 27 n.) errant,

cp. 1. 9n.
