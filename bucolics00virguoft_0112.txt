NOTES TO THE ECLOGUES.

him in deploring these missortunes, and both, as they walk‚ repeat
specimens of Menalcas‘ poetry, to show what a loss they would all
have sustained, had the master perished. Menalcas is understood to
represent Virgil himself, and the whole Eclogue is artfully contrived to
enlist the sympathy of its readers in the poet's favour. It must there-
fore be taken in close connexion with the First Eclogue. There Virgil
expresses his gratitude for the restitution of his farm under the circum-
stances already described; here he complains of a violent ejecti0n‚
and tries to secure the protection of Varus (11. 26—29), who, after the
defeat of M. Antonius in the Perusian War, had been substituted for
Pollio as legatus of Cisalpine Gaul, towards the end of 41 B.C.

It has been generally assumed ζ chiefly on the authority of Servius)
that Virgil was ejected a second time from his property, after the
reinstatement by Octavianus recorded in the First Eclogue, and that
the present Eclogue secured his final restoration. But Professor
Nettleship¹ has shown that this belief rests upon no solid founda-
tion. There is at all events nothing in the Eclogue itself to support
it. The story, as told by Moeris (ll. 2—6, 11—16), need only imply
that Virgil had at first hoped to retain his farm, probably through
Pollio's influence (hence the report alluded to in ll. 6-10) ; but that
finding himself mistaken, he addressed the new governor Varus in
his behalf, and through him, aided by Pollio and Gallus, he got the
introduction to Octavian, of which we know the result. This final
and only restoration occasioned the composition of the First Eclogue
(see note on ζ primus’ 1. 4 52, which must therefore be placed after the
Ninth in order of production, instead of before it. Hence the date of
the present Eclogue will be the end of 41 or the beginning of 40 B.C.

The details in the story of Virgil's ejectment are, as is often the
case, variously related. Probus mentions a soldier, Milienius Toro,
Servius a centurion named Arrius, as the person by whom the poet
was maltreated3 others say the assault arose out of a quarrel about
boundaries with a neighbour, Clodius. But such discrepancies
prove nothing as to the number of ejections, and it is quite possible
that Virgil may have been roughly handled‚ though not actually dis-
possessed, even after the order had been given to reinstate him.

The general plan of the Eclogue is taken from the T halys-ia, or
Seventh Idyll, of Theocritus, in which the goatherd Simichidas
meets with Lycidas in a country walk‚ and the two sing together by
turns as they g0. The local description in ll. 7, 8 seems certainly
intended to represent1the actual surroundings of Virgil’s farm; but
