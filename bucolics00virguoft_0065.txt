10. ludere, ‘to amuse myself' <by song). Cp. 6. 1; G. 4. 565
‘carmina qui lusi pastorum.' quae vellem, ‘at my pleasure.' If
permisit is a perfect proper ‘has allowed] vellem for velim is
noticeable. But permisit may be an aorist‚ ‘ gave me leave‚' on the
occasion alluded to in l. 43.

11. magis=p0t2‘us, ‘rather do 1 marvel? Cp. Catull. 68. ,χο

the lawlessness of the soldiers (1. 70).

13. protinus, ‘onward,' as in A. 10. 340, and elsewhere, but
